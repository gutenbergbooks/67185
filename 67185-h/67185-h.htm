CHAPTER I—UNDER THE SPREADING BEECH
</h2>

<p>“Was there ever such great luck, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Whew! for one, I feel like giving a vote of thanks to the striking
masons, who loafed pretty much all summer, and held the repair work on the
Bloomsbury High building up till now.”</p>

<p>“Them’s my sentiments, Elephant!”</p>

<p>“And they say now the work can’t be finished and school taken up till
December! What d’ye think of that, Frank, and you, Larry?”</p>

<p>“Glory to goodness! two extra months’ vacation, and right through
October too, when the chestnuts are ripe, and walnuts are dropping! What
bully days we’ve got ahead of us, boys!”</p>

<p>“And November, too, mind you,” went on the little “runt” who had been
called “Elephant” in a joke by his chums and could not shake off the name,
“the month when the frisky cottontail is also ripe. Say, Frank, won’t you
have a ge-lorious time trying out that new Marlin pump-gun
you got for your last birthday?”</p>

<p>The third member of the group sitting under the beech tree had as yet
not spoken, since his two companions started to give expression to their
extravagant delight over the wonderful news brought by Fenimore Cooper
Small, the aforesaid “Elephant,” whose father happened to be the head
Selectman of the town, and could fetch the decision of the Board of School
Trustees home before the rest of the worthy citizens had been put wise to
the facts.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank Bird, with one of his rare smiles that always made
him friends wherever he went, “I had a pretty good idea it would end that
way, when I heard how the trustees failed to find any building in town
that would answer to house the high school pupils. Yes, I’m glad for some
things, and sorry for others. But it’ll give the Bird boys a chance to do
a little more flying before winter sets in and stops all that fun.”</p>

<p>Frank and his cousin Andy had become quite famous throughout the region
around Bloomsbury, a town in Central New York, on account of the wonderful
success they had made of aviation.</p>

<p>Indeed, some of the doings of the Bird Boys, as they were
called, had even found their way into the columns of the big metropolitan
papers, and among professional birdmen they were looked upon as most
promising “comers.”</p>

<p>Back of Frank’s house—where he lived with his father, Professor Bird,
once a noted balloonist and scientist, together with an old gentleman who
had served as guardian to Frank when his father was believed to have
perished on one of his long flights while exploring parts of the Panama
Isthmus—in a field some distance in the rear of his house there had been
built a fine workshop, where the two boys spent most of their time when
not in the air.</p>

<p>Already they had invented quite a few ingenious contrivances which gave
promise that some day their names would figure along with those that have
made aviation in heavier-than-air machines what it is today—those of the
Wright brothers.</p>

<p>Close to this workshop was the great “hangar” in which they kept their
aeroplane when it was not in use; and since enemies had frequently tried
to injure their property these buildings were not only securely locked but
as a rule watched of nights.</p>

<p>To tell even a small portion of the doings of these bold cousins when
navigating the air would consume too much space and time;
and the reader who has been unfortunate enough not to have enjoyed their
perusal is referred back to the previous volumes in this Series, where
they will be found recorded at length, and the story told in an
entertaining manner.</p>

<p>The third member of the little group taking it easy under the wide
spreading beech tree, with its thick branches, was one Larry Geohegan, a
firm friend of the Bird boys; whose only fault was the envy he often felt
because he could never accompany either of his flying chums aloft, being
afflicted with a weakness that made him dizzy whenever he looked down from
any height.</p>

<p>Elephant had met the other two quite by accident on the road, and
stopped to communicate the grand news, which he had heard his father tell
at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>Apparently the other two lads were going fishing, for they had poles
and bait cans lying on the ground. There was a beautiful lake named
Sunrise, upon which the town lay; and a mile away a stream ran into this
which could always be depended upon to furnish a splendid string of bass,
chubs, sunfish and horned pouts or catfish, when the wind was favorable,
as happened on this lovely morning. “What were you waiting
here for under this tree; did you expect Andy to show up?” asked Elephant
after he had declared his intention of joining the fishing party, and
cutting a pole when he got on the grounds.</p>

<p>“Just what we did,” replied Frank. “He spent last night out at
Spencer’s, because as you all know, the old gentleman is especially fond
of Andy, and every once in so often begs him to come out and cheer him
up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they do say he means to leave all he’s got to Andy, in trust
of his father, Doctor Bird,” declared Larry, that little streak of envy
again making itself evident in his voice; for it did seem to him that
things were always coming to his chums and passing him by.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s silly talk,” laughed Frank, “I wouldn’t pay any attention
to it, if I were you, Larry. I’m sure Andy never gives such a thing a
thought. He’s only too glad to oblige the poor old man who’s so crippled
with rheumatism that he can hardly hobble around. And you know that years
and years ago he used to be a noted traveler, and a lecturer as well. Why,
fellows, there hasn’t hardly been a country on the face of the earth that
Mr. Spencer hasn’t visited, and explored. I could sit for
hours and just hear him tell about what he’s seen and gone through with. I
try to go out with Andy every chance I get; but last night I was too busy
with a knotty problem I had to solve.”</p>

<p>“I just bet you it was about some new contraption you’re making up to
surprise the flying people. Already you’ve done a heap along that line,
Frank; and they do say that the time is sure to come when you’ll give the
Wrights, and all that bunch, a rude jolt, by inventing something that
they’ve all been trying hard to discover, but nixey, nothing doing up to
date; because the time ain’t ripe, and the Bird boys haven’t had a fair
chance to show what they can do.”</p>

<p>Frank only laughed when Elephant applied this thick coat of flattery.
He was accustomed to hearing this sort of talk from that quarter; because
the Small boy had always been one of his greatest admirers from the time
when he and Andy were struggling with their first rude pattern of an
aeroplane, in which they had installed some sort of cranky engine, and
actually taken short flights, without getting their necks or legs
broken.</p>

<p>“But you must have agreed to meet Andy here then, didn’t you?” Elephant
went on to remark, stretching his neck to glance along the
road as he spoke.</p>

<p>“That was the agreement when he went off on his wheel yesterday
afternoon,” replied Frank Bird. “If the morning looked fishy, Larry and
myself were to wait here under the old beech at eight o’clock until he
came along. You see, I’ve got a pole for him; and we dug lots of worms.
Larry even went out last night with a lantern, and picked up a can of big
fat night-walkers that look like young snakes. I dropped in at Andy’s
house on the way here, and told them he wouldn’t be back till evening, if
the fish took good, and the bathing turned out fine. We’ve also got plenty
of grub along; yes, enough for you, too, Elephant.”</p>

<p>“Hoop-la! you make me feel happy when you say that, Frank; because I
was born with an appetite, you must know; and when I can’t get my grub at
least three times per diem I’m apt to complain,” and the Small boy grinned
good-naturedly as he made this remark.</p>

<p>“I say, Frank, have you and Andy invested that reward money the bank
insisted on you accepting when you captured the two hobo yeggmen who broke
into their safe; and also stole Percy Carberry’s biplane to make their
get-away in?” asked Larry, who, it might as well be
confessed right here, had a pretty average streak of curiosity in his
make-up, and was forever wanting to know this, that, and the other
thing.</p>

<p>“Oh!” answered the other carelessly, “we’ve still got that in bank, and
may put it into another machine later on; or else invest in some parts we
want to work with, Andy having a new idea this time that looks worth while
experimenting with.”</p>

<p>“You sure are the luckiest pair I ever ran up against, and that’s a
fact!” declared Larry.</p>

<p>“We think so ourselves,” Frank admitted. “There’s one thing certain,
and that is we don’t deserve all the great times we’ve been having this
year and more.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it!” exclaimed Elephant. “It ain’t luck so much as
being everlastingly at it, and minding how you do things. You deserve all
you’ve got, Frank; and lots of people say so besides me.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Andy,” remarked Larry, anxious to turn the conversation
just then, for he was really somewhat ashamed of his weakness, “I saw him
flash past that open place up the road, and spinning along like fun.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right there, Larry,” added Frank, “and here he is.”
 A boy mounted on a fine bicycle came whirling along the
road, and speedily drew up at the beech with the dense foliage, which
later on would yield a harvest of the small but sweet nuts boys love so
well when it is a “fat” season.</p>

<p>Andy Bird was not quite as tall as his cousin, though well built and
rather stocky at that. There was more or less resemblance between them,
although their temperaments differed in many ways, Andy being more
inclined to impulsiveness than the cooler and far-seeing Frank. But they
were exceedingly fond of each other, and had been inseparable for
years.</p>

<p>Andy threw himself from his saddle, and lowering his wheel to the
ground after the usual boyish way, dropped down beside the others.</p>

<p>“Whew! I hit it up at a lively clip all the way down!” he remarked.
“You see, it’s awful hard to break away from Mr. Spencer, and he kept me
up to the last minute. I knew you said eight o’clock, Frank, and I didn’t
want to keep you waiting. Glad you turned up, Elephant; we tried to get
you on the phone yesterday afternoon; but they said you’d gone off, and
nobody knew where. Going with us, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Make your mind easy on that, Andy,” replied the
diminutive Elephant, glibly. “I never could hold out when there was any
fishing going on. I just revel in pulling out the gamey bass, the festive
catfish, and the acrobatic eel; while as for perch and pickerel and
sunfish, why, I delight to see them wriggling on the hook, ready to take
their places in the pan. See you’ve got a fryingpan along, Larry; and that
means we’ll have fish for dinner today—after we grab ’em out of the
water.”</p>

<p>“But Andy, think of the bully good news Elephant’s gone and brought with
him,” Larry went on to say, jubilantly, “the trustees have finally decided
that, as the big repairs on the high school building have been started,
and can’t possibly be done till early winter, why, because there’s no
place in town that could be used just now, vacation has got to be
lengthened until about the first of December.”</p>

<p>Andy Bird looked delighted, as what boy would not. Immediately his eyes
traveled in the direction of his cousin, and there was exchanged between
them a significant series of nods and winks, that possibly meant their
thoughts were along the same lines; and that now they would have the time
to go with certain work that had been taking their attention of late.
 “By the way,” said Frank, “I stopped at your house on the
way out, Andy, to tell your father that you would go fishing with us, and
not to expect you till night. And he gave me a letter for you that he said
had come in the early morning mail. From the postmark I see it’s from your
uncle Jethro, away down on that Arizona ranch you were telling me about.
Here it is, and a fine fat one too.”</p>

<p>Andy hastily opened the letter, and was heard to give vent to a low cry
that seemed to spell both astonishment and delight.</p>

<p>“What’s this mean?” exclaimed Frank, stooping to pick up a paper that
had fallen to the ground, “why, as sure as you live, it’s a check made out
to you, Andy, and signed by the old bachelor uncle, your mother’s brother.
Hold your breath, fellows, while I whisper what the amount is he takes
pleasure in sending to his beloved nephew—four figures in it, as sure as
you live—a clean thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>Larry gave a groan and threw up his hands while his eyes rolled.</p>

<p>“Of all the lucky fellows, you Bird boys do certain sure take the
cake!” he cried.</p>

<h2 title='Glorious News' id='chII'>
CHAPTER II—GLORIOUS NEWS
</h2>

<p>“Ain’t you going to read it out, Andy?” asked Elephant, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Wait till he gets through, can’t you?” asked Larry, although he was
fairly trembling with eagerness to hear what the sending of that glorious
check could mean; when he looked at the small bit of paper Frank was
holding he almost held his breath with awe, for to tell the truth Larry
had never seen a check a quarter as large as that in all his life.</p>

<p>Andy could not say a word when he finished reading. He seemed to be
fairly overpowered with emotion, and holding the letter out to Frank,
motioned that he should accommodate the other two.</p>

<p>And so Frank started in. The letter was written in a cramped hand, as
if uncle Jethro Witherspoon had rather lost the knack of using a pen; but
then Frank could wade through it, even if he did hesitate here and
there.</p>

<p>It started in after this fashion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“My Dear Nephew, Andrew Bird:—I’ve been hearing a whole lot about the
way you and your cousin Frank are coming along with that
 airship business, and your mother has got me worked up to
pretty nigh fever pitch about your precious doing. Now here I am, an old
and cranky bachelor, with a big and successful cattle ranch on my hands,
and no chick or child to cheer me up. I want you two boys to pay me a long
visit, and bring that wonder of an aeroplane along with you. I sounded
your mother some time back, without her letting you know, and she was
agreeable, if only it could be arranged without interfering with your
school duties. And here today your good dad, the doctor, has wired me that
he believes there is going to be an extension of the vacation period for
another two months.</p>

<p>“Seems like things might be working to please a lonely old man out this
way. Now here’s a little check to cover expenses. If you need any more
draw on me to any amount. What’s money for anyway but to give pleasure to
somebody? Pack up that flying machine of yours, and either tuck it under
your arm or else ship it by the fastest express you can get to receive it,
regardless of cost.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to take no for an answer. I want you and that smart
cousin Frank down here to show some of my cow-punchers what’s doing in the
line of this flying business. But most of all I want to see
you. I’ve got your pictures before me as I write, and I’m counting the
days until you arrive, bag and baggage. Wire me on receipt of this all
about your plans and when you can start. If you say you can’t come, I’m
going up after you. I’m used to having my own way, the boys down here will
tell you. With lots of love, believe me,</p>

<div class='tar mr40'>“Your affectionate uncle,</div>
<div class='tar sc'>“Jethro Witherspoon.”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>When Frank finished reading this remarkable letter, Larry gasped for
breath; while little Elephant stood on his hands and cracked his heels
together.</p>

<p>“That sure takes the cake, Andy, Frank!” he declared, when he had once
more resumed his customary position, with his head higher than his heels.
“And my stars! what a ge-lorious time you two will have of it, away down
in that desert corner of Arizona! Cowboys—bucking bronchos—whirling
ropes—branding cattle—the merry round-up—the camp-outs on the plains,
and all them stunts. Oh! what wouldn’t I give to be going along with you,
fellers?”</p>

<p>“It’s always better to be born lucky than rich; I’ve said that before,
and I’m ready to stick by it!” stoutly asserted Larry. 
“Frank, can we go, do you think?” asked Andy, almost in a whisper, as
though he had hardly as yet recovered his breath, taken away at the
wonderful news contained in that letter which his cousin had brought
him.</p>

<p>“We’ll think it over and see,” replied the other, always avoiding the
rush tactics that Andy frequently displayed, and which made him a valued
member of the Bloomsbury High football eleven. “But I rather guess it
could be arranged, if my father is willing.”</p>

<p>“Huh! no danger of him saying no,” grunted Larry. “He ought to know
that you two boys can take care of yourselves anywhere on the face of the
earth. After you went down to Colombia in South America, and figured out
where he must have drifted to, when he lost control of his balloon;
afterwards rescuing him from that queer old valley surrounded by the high
cliffs, that made him a prisoner, the Professor’d say yes if you wanted to
try a trip to the moon. And some of us’d believe you, if you said you’d
been that far in your airship, and shook hands with the Old Man up
there.”</p>

<p>“But he wants us to take our aeroplane along, Frank; could we pack that
up and send it by express, do you think? Will they take anything as big
and cumbersome as that, in boxes or crates, by express?”
Andy went on, eagerly, as though in his mind the fact of their going was
already assured.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ll take anything short of a house!” declared Elephant.
“Even if it needs a special car to carry it along. If you sent the thing
by freight, chances are it’d be a whole month getting there.”</p>

<p>“And time counts with Uncle Jethro more than money does with most men,”
remarked Larry. “You see he wants to get you there with your flier
regardless of expense. Why, I’d wire him tonight, Andy, and pack up in a
couple of days. Elephant ’nd me’ll help out all we can.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say we’d thank you for the chance,” spoke up the Small
boy.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to believe we’ve got such a great chance to see something of
that country down there among the mountains and deserts and plains of
Arizona,” Andy went on to say, as though he wanted some one to stick him
with a pin, so as to find out whether he were really awake, or only
dreaming.</p>

<p>“And I never dreamed we’d have such a great opening to visit that
country,” the other Bird boy went on to say, while his face beamed with
delight which refused to be repressed. “That uncle of yours
must be a fine old chap, Andy. His letter is a peach, and I’m as sure as
anything we’ll like him from the word go. Think of his throwing you a
check for a thousand just like it might be thirty cents; and telling you
to draw on him to any amount. He must think we’ll be wanting to charter a
special train to take us and the aeroplane along.”</p>

<p>“Chances are he’d stand for it,” ventured Larry. “Say, why didn’t some
rich old uncle of mine think of me, and send a little piece of paper this
way? I’ve got half a dozen wealthy ones, but they don’t know I’m on the
face of the earth.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Elephant, “get busy then, and make the name of Geohegan
famous, and then they’ll all break their necks trying to get you to let
’em adopt you. The trouble is, Larry, you hide your light under a bushel
too much. Fly high, like the Bird boys do, and everybody ’ll see what you
are.”</p>

<p>The other gave a dismal groan.</p>

<p>“That’s just what ails me,” he complained, “I can’t fly at all. Why, I
get dizzy in a swing; and even when I go out on the lake, if she’s the
least bit rough, you’ll find me hangin’ over the side right away, tryin’
to see how deep it is, and wonderin’ if drowning’d stop my
 troubles easy like. I reckon I’ll just have to make up my
mind that if ever I set this old world afire, it’s got to be by doin’ some
stupendous intellectual stunt. That seems to be my long hold, just as
eatin’s yours, Elephant.”</p>

<p>“Rats,” jeered the other, contemptuously, “as if you couldn’t stow away
twice as much as me any day you felt like it. I talk a heap about the grub
racket; but you can work them jaws of yours to beat the band, Larry
Geohegan.”</p>

<p>“Well, do we start off now, or fuss around and chatter like a lot of
monkeys?” demanded the party thus referred to by Elephant.</p>

<p>“What about your wheel, Andy; you don’t want to lug that along through
the timber by that snaky trail?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“I had fixed all that in my mind as I pedalled,” was the reply. “You
know we have to pass the Fletcher place just above here, before we strike
off the road, and I can leave the bike there till we come out this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” commented Elephant, nodding his head sagely;
just as though when he approved of a suggestion it had the hall mark of
wisdom stamped on it.</p>

<p>“I’ve done that more’n once when I had my wheel along,” declared Larry,
bent on showing his chums that he could have an original
idea once in a while, even though fame had not picked him out for a
favorite.</p>

<p>“Did you bring a pole along for me, Frank?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“Yes, and plenty of hooks, and lines, and sinkers, and what-not,”
replied the one addressed. “Elephant, here, says he’ll cut a pole after we
get on the ground; and the chances are he’ll be the luckiest fisherman of
the lot. Nearly always turns out that way, I notice; for the fellow who
just takes things as they come along gets the biggest fish and the
greatest number. Now, you see, I’ve got a rod along, a real jointed split
bamboo rod that was given to me last Christmas by my guardian, old Colonel
Whympers. I’m going to be the toney angler, and try all sorts of stunts
while the rest of you are pulling in the fish. But to me a pound bass
caught on light tackle is better than one that weighs three times as
heavy, if I have to just yank him in with a pole, and a cord tied to the
end—no reel, no fine leader, only a hook in a bunch of wiggling worms,
and a float above the sinker.”</p>

<p>“Huh! you’re getting big notions, Frank,” grunted Larry. “Time was when
you seemed just as well pleased with one of these long cane
 poles. I’m mighty much afraid you’re getting spoiled, my
boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, if somebody made you a present of a beautiful jointed rod like
that, now, Larry——” began Andy.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no chance for that to happen; nobody ever thinks to remember my
birthday, ’cept you fellers; when you pound me nearly to death, and then
treat to the ice cream to make up for it,” Larry lamented, dolefully.</p>

<p>“But supposing they did,” persisted Andy, who never liked to give up
anything on which he had started; “now, wouldn’t you want to get
acquainted with it; and if you caught a good fish that way, and felt how
he pulled, and saw the slender rod bend nearly double, wouldn’t you want
to try it again and again, honest Injun, Larry tell me?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I guess so, Andy,” answered the other, making a grimace, “but
there ain’t no such luck for me. I must a been born under an evil star, my
mom says, because I’m always bustin’ things at home. She says it’s because
I’m so clumsy; but I know better. Why, seems like some things just fall
over and smash, when I happen to look at ’em.”</p>

<p>“Then for goodness sake quit looking at me like that, Larry!” exclaimed
Elephant. “I ain’t got no hoops around me right now, and I
tell you I don’t want to bust any—not till after we’ve had that bully old
camp dinner today, anyhow. Just turn your eyes the other way, thank
you.”</p>

<p>Andy had meanwhile carefully placed the wonderful check inside the
envelope once more, and with a pin fastened the latter in his coat pocket.
It was Frank’s suggestion that he do this; for the latter knew from
experience that Andy could be a bit careless at times. And the thought of
losing that windfall, when so delightful a future beckoned to them through
its means, would be enough to give any boy the heart-ache.</p>

<p>“All ready, boys?” asked Frank, presently, as he stooped and carefully
picked up the little covered case in which his fine rod lay, each joint
reposing in the groove that was made to hold it.</p>

<p>“Yep. Let me carry the poles, Larry. You’re always getting things
caught in the bushes and trees as we go along. Why, only the last time we
came fishin’ didn’t you hook me in the ear, and make me howl like
anything? You take care of that fryingpan, and the bundle of grub. And
walk ahead, so’s we c’n kinder keep an eye on you, please, Larry.”</p>

<p>“Huh! think you’re smart to say that, don’t you,
Elephant?” grunted the other, but in spite of the fact that these two were
usually in some sort of a “spat,” they were really great friends, and
ready to do almost anything, one for the other.</p>

<p>So the four boys left the shelter of the fine old beech that stood
alongside the road, while its mates grew over on the other fence; for
strangely enough, Frank had noticed that beech trees like company, and are
rarely if ever, found alone.</p>

<p>They walked briskly along the road, with their backs turned in the
direction of the not far distant town. A little ways off they would climb
the fence, pass through a field, enter the woods, and by a short-cut reach
the fishing grounds much more easily than if they had skirted the lake,
and coming to the little river, followed up its sinuous course.</p>

<p>Just as they came to the bend a short ways above, Larry, who was ahead,
happening to turn around in order to say something was seen to stare, and
then exclaim:</p>

<p>“Well, now, if that don’t beat anything going!”</p>

<p>Of course his strange words, together with the look on his face,
aroused the curiosity of the other three boys. They, too, turned their
 heads, thinking in this fashion to discover what had given
Larry so great a shock; but so far as they could see, there was nothing at
all in sight.</p>

<p>“What was it?” demanded Andy.</p>

<p>“Did you see somebody?” demanded Elephant, getting his poles in every
sort of trouble, in his eagerness to learn what it was all about back
there.</p>

<p>“Yes, and what do you think, fellows, he just dropped down out of the
branches of that big birch tree, and hurried into the bushes like fun.
Take my word for it, he must a-been up there all the time we was sittin’
talking; and if that’s so, he learned about Andy here getting that letter
and check from Uncle Jethro, ’way down in the cow-puncher country.”</p>

<p>“But who in the mischief was it, Larry, did you know him?” persisted
Elephant.</p>

<p>“I should say yes; and who but that sneak of a Sandy Hollingshead, the
shadow that hangs around after Percy Carberry, and does most of his mean
work for him. And chances are, he’s makin’ for town right now, to tell all
he’s learned. Say, won’t your old rival, Percy, be mad, though, when he
hears of the luck that has come to the Bird boys?”</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='Looking For Trouble' id='chIII'>
CHAPTER III—LOOKING FOR TROUBLE
</h2>

<p>Andy looked somewhat serious when Larry said this; but Frank on his
part only laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, what does it matter?” he remarked. “The thing will be town talk
in a little while, and those fellows would hear it that way. Let Sandy run
with his great news and give his chum a pain. You don’t think for a minute
that because we’ve got a chance to go off there to the cattle country,
that Percy Carberry would make up his mind to hike that way, with some
sort of machine he’s got coming, to take the place of that new biplane the
bank thieves wrecked for him in Lake Ontario?”</p>

<p>“But you know how bitter he’s always been against us, Frank?”
expostulated Andy.</p>

<p>“Many’s the time he’s tried to do us a bad turn; and even up in the air
he used to take the greatest delight in swooping past us, just as close as
he dared, and give us a scare; though he quit that when you threatened to
lick him.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you do Perc a great favor that time he had his machine
knocked to flinders on the table rock up yonder?” demanded Elephant,
turning to point his rods upwards to where quite a mountain
reared its head toward the clouds, and which was locally known as Old
Thunder-Top, though in the atlas it had another name.</p>

<p>Nobody had ever been able to climb to the summit of that precipitous
height, and when the Bird boys landed there once from their aeroplane and
planted a flag above the nest of the white-headed eagles they achieved a
great triumph. The incident to which Elephant alluded had been brought
about during a sudden thunder storm that had caught the rival aeroplanes
while making a flight to the top of the mountain; and at that time the
Bird boys were indeed placed in a position to save the lives of Percy
Carberry and his comrade Sandy; but since gratitude was a foreign element
in the make-up of the jealous rival, he had never shown that he meant to
change his tactics toward Frank and Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh! never mind about what we did,” remarked Frank. “Forget it, just as
Percy has done. Tomorrow, we’ll get as busy as beavers, packing the
machine in the cases; and how lucky we didn’t break them up as you wanted
to do, Andy, just to get rid of the stuff, you said. I guess we ought to
be able to ship on the next day, and then learn just how long it’ll be on
 the way, so we can time our own going.”</p>

<p>“Huh! seems to me you ain’t botherin’ much about whether your dad’ll
give his consent, eh, Frank?” remarked Larry, grinning.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m taking that for granted; because you all seemed so sure he
wouldn’t refuse me that favor,” chuckled Frank. “But come along, boys;
what do we care if Sandy did get the news first hand, by climbing that
tree when he saw us coming along the road, and keeping those big ears of
his wide open. So far as I’m concerned I’d just as soon tell them myself
all about our plans; because if we’re away down in Arizona, and they stay
here in old Bloomsbury, I don’t think Percy’s got a long enough arm to
reach that far, and do us any harm.”</p>

<p>“He sure would if he could, and don’t you forget it,” muttered
Elephant; and at that Andy looked more or less troubled.</p>

<p>As our story concerns the doings of the Bird boys in other fields than
that of their old stamping grounds around the home town, we need not
accompany them further on their visit to the fishing hole. Enough to state
that the finny tribes bit eagerly at times, and that besides having a fish
dinner at noon, they all carried home respectable strings to exhibit as
 evidence of their prowess with hook and line.</p>

<p>Frank doubtless felt satisfied with his sport, even though he did not
take the largest bass, nor the greatest number for that matter; and the
whole of them came home by sundown, tired, yet satisfied with the day’s
sport.</p>

<p>During the many hours spent alongside the deep hole where the fish
loved to lie in these late summer days, there was plenty of time in which
to discuss the coming departure of Frank and Andy for the Far West. And it
can be set down as certain that the subject was threshed as dry as a bone
before the quartette separated for the night.</p>

<p>Early the next day Elephant and Larry showed up at Frank’s house, to
find him already busily at work out there at the hangar, taking off bolts,
and dismembering the wonderful aeroplane with the confidence of one who
was familiar with every minute detail of its construction; which was only
the truth, for with his cousin he had partly built at least three “fliers”
up to now, and was continually thinking up some new arrangement that would
make the task of piloting aeroplanes through the upper air currents much
easier, or possibly add to their safety when rocked by furious gusts of
wind among the clouds. Andy soon showed up, and almost
quivering with eagerness to get busy. There did not seem to be the
slightest thing in sight to disturb the two who were planning such great
things.</p>

<p>And that was indeed a busy morning for the four friends.</p>

<p>Elephant and Larry were only too anxious to do all that lay in their
power, in order to assist. True, their knowledge of the mechanism
connected with these amazing air travelers was rather limited; but then
both were willing to do odd jobs of carrying, and nailing up cases; so
that altogether they made themselves very useful indeed.</p>

<p>Larry managed to bottle up his envy on this occasion, and even seemed
quite gay. As a rule he was a good companion, cheerful, willing, and
generous to a degree. And Elephant could hardly have been any happier even
though given the opportunity to accompany the pair of adventurous voyagers
on their long trip.</p>

<p>Then came the afternoon session, and they went at it with renewed vim.
It is astonishing what an amount of solid work four husky boys can put in
during a whole day with the tools, especially when two of them are as
expert in handling monkey wrenches and the like as Frank and
Andy were.</p>

<p>By four o’clock the aeroplane had been completely and securely packed,
and they were waiting for the big truck which Frank had engaged at the
livery stable, to show up, in order to carry the same to the freight
station of the railroad.</p>

<p>The man presently came along, and with the help of the four boys the
various boxes and crates were loaded. Then they started off, headed for
the railroad; and as their route lay directly through town it was not long
before quite a following of youngsters trailed along, chattering about the
mysterious way in which Frank Bird was about to ship his aeroplane, and
inventing all sorts of miraculous stories about certain races in which the
two cousins were slated to take part; until one boy more daring than his
mates, managed to climb up on the truck, and read the address which had
been plainly printed on every piece of freight.</p>

<p>So it was known that the aeroplane was being shipped far away to
Arizona; and it may be set down as certain that this fact only served to
whet the curiosity of that crowd of half-grown lads more than ever.</p>

<p>Frank had learned on the preceding evening how it would
have to be sent out. The express people would handle it after a certain
fashion, shipping by what they called fast freight. The agent calculated
that in this way it would take about ten or twelve days for the aeroplane
to reach the border town where Andy’s uncle was to meet them upon their
arrival.</p>

<p>Of course that meant a long delay, and much fretting; but it was the
best that could be arranged, and Andy had to abide by it. But between them
he and Elephant and Larry had decided that they would not let the precious
freight go unguarded for a minute, until it was placed in a car on the
following morning, and had left Bloomsbury on the freight that would rush
it to the nearest city, where it could be attached to the fast train that
left daily for Western points.</p>

<p>Frank was inclined to make fun of his cousin for his suspicions, and
declared that according to his mind they had nothing to fear, except the
possibilities of a fire sweeping down upon the ramshackle freight house,
which was the best Bloomsbury could boast until the new stone one was
completed.</p>

<p>“Do just whatever you want to, boys,” he had remarked, after they had
received the receipt for the freight, and paid the charges all
 the way through, with some of the cash that wonderful check
had been exchanged for after Andy had written his full name across the
back; “but I rather think you’ll have all your trouble for your pains. As
for me, I’ve got a few important things to work at tonight, and so, if you
don’t mind, I’ll spend the time in the shop. Good luck to you all! Let me
know the first thing in the morning if everything’s O.K.” With that Frank
swung around on his heel and strode away.</p>

<p>“How about that, Andy,” demanded Larry, when they saw Frank vanish
beyond the open door of the freight shed; “is he really giving us the hook
because we think it best to watch the blooming freight tonight, for fear
that tricky Perc Carberry and his man Friday, I mean Sandy, swoop down
upon it, and do something to make your fine airship good only for the
scrap-heap?”</p>

<p>Andy laughed as he replied:</p>

<p>“You just don’t know Frank as well as I do,” he observed. “Chances are
that if we hadn’t set up that howl about being afraid something was going
to happen here, my cousin would have quietly sneaked along this way after
dark, and stood on guard the whole blessed night.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you say, Andy, and he just laughed at us too? I didn’t 
think Frank had it in him to play a joke like that,” exclaimed Elephant, 
looking hurt.</p> 

<p>“Well,” went on Andy Bird, “you see he knew we were bent on keeping
guard here, and Frank does hate to see anybody disappointed; so he just
let us have our own way about it. And then when he said he had something
important to do at our shop, he spoke the truth; because he’s right now on
the heels of a discovery that may mean a whole lot to us.”</p>

<p>“All right,” remarked Larry. “We’re only too glad to let Frank off, and
run the whole shooting match ourselves, for once. Now, how shall we fix it
so every fellow can get home to supper, and yet keep tab on what’s going
on here all the while?”</p>

<p>This was very easily adjusted, however. They left Larry on guard,
because he said his folks had supper later than the rest; and both
Elephant and Andy promised to hurry back as soon as they could get enough
to eat; and let their folks know just why they did not expect to occupy
their beds that night.</p>

<p>This plan worked all right.</p>

<p>When the two boys turned up together, one having called for the other,
of course the first thing they asked Larry was whether
anything had happened; perhaps their sharp eyes detected the fact that he
looked somewhat excited, and they judged that this could hardly be unless
he had seen something suspicious.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Larry, with his favorite drawl, “I kept myself hid
just as nice as you please, and I was glad I’d been so smart; because who
should walk in here talking to the agent but Perc himself. Seemed to be
asking if any freight had come along for him, and made out to be pretty
huffy over the delay of the railroad to deliver stuff. Got the agent to
hustle around, looking to see whether it could a-been overlooked, and
hidden out of sight behind other things. But say, when he was sure the
other’s back was turned, what did Perc do but step up to your stuff, Andy,
and take a quick look at the directions you marked on each package. Then I
heard him chuckle, step back, and measure distances with his eye; just
like a feller might do that expected to come back here in the dark and
prowl around and wanted to get his bearings well in his head!”</p>

<p>“Wow! now what d’ye think of that?” exclaimed Elephant, showing his
white teeth aggressively, and doubling up his diminutive fist; for,
although unusually small in stature, he was a spirited lad;
just as the little bantam rooster seems ready to fight a big Plymouth
Rock, or a Shanghai, for that matter, if the opportunity offers, and he
feels that his dignity has been affronted.</p>

<p>Andy nodded his head, and looked rather pleased.</p>

<p>“Let’em come,” he said, “it won’t be the first time I’ve lain in wait,
expecting a sneaking night visit from Percy Carberry and some of his
crowd. And history has a way of repeating itself; so in that case he’s
going to be in for a mighty unpleasant experience, or my name isn’t Andy
Bird.”</p>

<p>The boys had thought fit to approach the agent, and tell him that since
there was no way of locking up the heavy freight that lay around under
that shed; and they had reason to fear that an attempt would be made to
injure the crated aeroplane, they meant to watch throughout the night. Of
course, he had not the slightest objection to offer. The company would be
liable to damages should any occur, but that would prove but sorry
compensation to the Bird boys for the loss of their aeroplane; since such
a catastrophe was apt to prevent them from accepting the warm invitation
of Uncle Jethro in far-away Arizona. And after night set in
the three sentries arranged matters to suit the plans of Andy, who had
figured out a little scheme which he believed would cover the ground, and
not only warn them when intruders started to lay hostile hands on the
freight, but play havoc with their mean plans.</p>

<p>The time passed slowly, and it must have been very near midnight when
they heard the first indication that prowlers were about. The hanging door
at the end of the old freight shed squeaked somewhat when moved; and this
sound came plainly to the ears of Andy and his two chums.</p>

<p>They touched each other, as if to give warning, and to make sure that
no one of the guardians of the boxed aeroplanes could by any possibility
be asleep. Then they got themselves ready to meet the intruders with a
little surprise that was calculated to give them more or less of a
shock.</p>

<p>And as the three friends crouched there behind the boxes which they had
moved in position for this very same purpose, they heard low faint
whispering sounds that seemed to be gradually drawing closer and closer,
as though those who groped their way in the dark might be
comparing notes, and thus deciding whether they were moving along the
right track.</p>

<p>It looked as though the crisis might be very near; and that in perhaps
another minute they would be compelled to throw off the mask and give the
skulkers the surprise of their lives.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='The Panic That Came to Pass' id='chIV'>
CHAPTER IV—THE PANIC THAT CAME TO PASS
</h2>

<p>“H’st! flash that light a little!”</p>

<p>These low words were plainly heard by the two concealed boys. They came
immediately after there had been some sort of head-on collision between a
couple of the prowlers, which had resulted in grunts, and a plain
unmistakable groan.</p>

<p>Immediately a little shaft of bright light began moving this way and
that. Some one carried a very small edition of an electric flash-light. It
gave only an apology for a glow, and yet by moving this to the right and
to the left, it would be possible to discover obstructions, and thus avoid
any further collisions.</p>

<p>Besides this, the eager searching eyes of the intruders would be apt to
discover the boxed aeroplane, for undoubtedly Percy was one of the lot,
and he must have marked the whereabouts of the freight pretty accurately
in his mind, at the time he wandered around with the agent, pretending to
search for his own stuff.</p>

<p>“I see it!” some one said, in a satisfied tone.</p>

<p>“Then for goodness sake show us,” grumbled another
fellow, who was possibly rubbing an injured head or arm as he spoke.</p>

<p>“This way, everybody; and get ready to do what I say!”</p>

<p>That must surely be Percy Carberry talking, though neither Andy nor
Elephant, nor yet Larry, could recognize the voice, which seemed strangely
muffled. But the closer they examined the three approaching figures,
slouching along in a half hearted way, as though conscious of the danger
that hung over their heads while thus entering upon the property of the
railroad, the more convinced Andy and his chums became that they had some
sort of muffler fastened across the lower part of their faces, which
interfered with their voices.</p>

<p>Perhaps this had been done in the hope and expectation that, if by
chance they were discovered while attempting to injure the aeroplane, they
might pass for a lot of hobos attempting to pilfer something from the
railroad yards that could be sold for enough money to buy liquor.</p>

<p>Andy gave each of his companions a nudge, for Elephant was ranged on
one side, while Larry crouched on the other. This was understood to be a
signal. It just as much as said, “get ready now, to let go when you hear
me start in!” And both of the others immediately drew in the
greatest breath they were capable of containing, according to the capacity
of their lungs.</p>

<p>That odd little glow kept wavering around in a queer manner. If Percy
were holding the electric torch in his hand he must be trying to show his
companions just how things lay, so that they could see how to get to
work.</p>

<p>In that moment of intense excitement none of the watchers thought of
trying to guess what sort of mischief the prowlers had in view. It was
quite enough for them to know that the precious aeroplane was the object
of their malicious scheming.</p>

<p>“Are you all on?” demanded a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” came from two other quarters, for the three intruders seemed to
have ranged along side the heap of freight in as many different quarters,
as though it might be their prearranged plan to attack it from various
points.</p>

<p>“Then get busy with you, fellows!”</p>

<p>That was of course the last straw on the camel’s back. When Andy heard
these words, and realized that the attack on the boxed flying machine was
about to start in, he could hold back no longer.</p>

<p>“Soak ’em, tigers!” The words were shouted at the top of
his voice; and both Larry and the Small boy joined in the refrain, making
all the noise they could possibly bring to bear, according to the amount
of wind they had pent up in their lungs.</p>

<p>No doubt the outburst of sound must have struck terror to the hearts of
the trio of guilty skulkers, already very nervous on account of their
knowledge that they were doing a mean and criminal act. In that minute
they probably received one of the greatest shocks of their lives. Detected
in wrong-doing their consciences must have stabbed them like sharp-pointed
knives; and the possible shameful results of being caught in the act, and
held up as awful examples before the rest of the town, gave them a
wrench.</p>

<p>But that was not all.</p>

<p>Andy and his companions had made preparations for bombarding the enemy
with a shower of stones that were of no mean size. While the scantiness of
the illumination might make such a thing as taking aim a difficult task,
still, at such close quarters there were sure to be frequent collisions
between the rapidly flying missiles and some parts of the bodies of the
fleeing boys. Above the cries of the assailants could be
heard the shouts which the retreating skulkers gave vent to, as they fell
over unseen packages of freight, banged headlong against walls that seemed
strangely out of place, and doubtless accumulated a fine collection of
bumps and bruises that would remind them of the adventure for a long time
to come.</p>

<p>Of course, as soon as the flight was fully on, Andy and his chums
ceased bombarding the panic-stricken enemy, thinking that they had enough
troubles of their own in trying to make the partly open door of the
shed.</p>

<p>When he went home to supper Andy had secured a little hand torch of his
own, and one that possessed considerable more power than that Percy had
fetched along. This he now brought into play; and by shooting the shaft of
light ahead he was able to discover the three fleeing figures nearing the
exit, and sprawling every-which-way, as they met up with obstacles of all
sorts.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s capture ’em!” shouted Andy, and with his companions he
started as if in hot pursuit, though of course this was meant only as a
little additional spur, to add to the alarm of the runners.</p>

<p>When Andy and the other two boys broke out of the end of
the freight shed they could still hear the frightened fellows banging up
against things, for the yard was not kept as neatly as it might have been.
One flying figure that they gave chase to fell into an open culvert, and
though they looked for him, he had evidently crawled far underneath, in
his great alarm, for they could not find a trace of the poor wretch, who
must have remained there, wet and shivering, for hours, before he mustered
up enough courage to crawl out and sneak home.</p>

<p>Another made a headlong plunge over a pile of scrap iron; and though he
managed to scramble excitedly to his feet, when he went off it was hopping
on one leg a good deal of the way, and with a series of grunts that told
how it hurt.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s enough, fellows,” wheezed Andy, for he was himself so
out of breath that he could hardly talk.</p>

<p>The first thing they all did was to bend over, and laugh until their
sides really ached. It doubtless looked mighty humorous to the three who
had done all the chasing; but those other fellows would have a different
story to tell, if asked. But then the old fable is always true, and what
is “fun for the boys is death to the frogs;” no fellow ever
plays a practical joke that amuses him highly, but what some one has to
pay the bill and do the crying.</p>

<p>So Andy led his army back once more to the interior of the freight
shed.</p>

<p>“Let’s look to see if they managed to do the first bit of damage,”
suggested the leader, and quickly adding, “why, looky here what they’ve
gone and left behind ’em—a hatchet, an augur, a chisel, a screw
driver—enough tools to stock a carpenter shop. Now, if we knew who owned
these, we’d have it on him pretty strong.”</p>

<p>But when, in the morning, Andy started an investigation, thinking that
the tools might serve to identify the three boys who had entered the
railroad freight shed bent on damaging the crated aeroplane, he found that
Percy Carberry with his customary shrewdness had looked out for this and
covered his tracks deftly.</p>

<p>The tools upon being exhibited were soon claimed by Mr. Mallet, the
carpenter, who said that when he reached his shop that morning he found a
window had been forced, and quite a quantity of his property carried away.
And so it was rendered impossible to identify the rascals by the abandoned
tools.</p>

<p>Of course, had Andy wished to carry the thing further he
might have drawn attention to the fact that Percy Carberry, Sandy
Hollingshead, and another boy often seen in their company were absent from
their customary haunts that morning; and if interviewed at home would be
found to have sundry patches of court plaster adorning their noses and
foreheads which would indicate that there must have been an epidemic of
falling out of bed on the preceding night. But of course Andy did not mean
to pursue the matter any further, believing that “all was well that ended
well,” and that the boys had already been sufficiently punished.</p>

<p>What he did do immediately after leaving the shed was to call up Frank
on the phone at the drug store. Frank did not often oversleep, but being
up late on the night before, seemed to cause him to lie abed a little
later on this morning. He happened to be eating his breakfast at the time
the bell rang; and as the phone was in the diningroom of course he
answered it.</p>

<p>“Hello! this you, Frank?” came in a voice he recognized as belonging to
Andy.</p>

<p>“Yes, what’s all this row about?” answered Frank, humorously.</p>

<p>“Coming down here soon; I’m at the drugstore close to the
station, you know?” the other went on to say.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter—anything happen?” demanded the boy at the other end
of the wire as if realizing from Andy’s manner that there had something
occurred that must be out of the common.</p>

<p>“Sure. We had company, and the greatest old time you ever heard of,
Frank. Tell you about it when you get here. We’re going to breakfast now,
and will meet you at the freight shed later to see the stuff packed in the
car.”</p>

<p>“Hold on. Was there any damage done to our machine?” demanded the
other.</p>

<p>“Never a scratch; but it was a close shave. So-long, Frank; see you
later!” and having accomplished his object, which was to excite his
cousin’s curiosity to fever pitch, for it was seldom he had the chance to
do such a thing as this, Andy abruptly severed connections and hurried
home to get something to eat.</p>

<p>Frank was there all right when Andy got back to the station; and
doubtless he had managed to pick up some sort of an account of what had
happened; for he seemed to be cross-questioning one of the freight
handlers, even while examining the boxed and crated aeroplane.
 Of course Andy gave him the whole story; and as both
Elephant and Larry had by this time shown up, the four of them laughed
again and again, while each of the several witnesses of the panic related
their version of the affair, adding such humorous touches as might occur
to them.</p>

<p>The boys agreed to let the matter drop, since Percy and his cronies
must have been sufficiently punished. Besides, being boys, they were not
inclined to be hard on other fellows; even though they felt more or less
indignation at the mean way in which Percy Carberry always tried to even
his scores.</p>

<p>One thing sure, they meant to hang around that station until the
precious aeroplane was not only securely placed in a car, but the train
pulled out that was to start it on its long western journey to the
far-away Arizona cattle ranch where Uncle Jethro waited to receive them
with open arms.</p>

<p>And there they did remain until the train pulled out and they had the
last glimpse of the precious air wonder, safely stowed in its car and
headed toward the Land of Promise.</p>

<p>After that the boys were content to walk home, where Frank and Andy
soon got busy again in their shop; for they had many things
 in process of building, on which they could always spend a
spare hour; while Larry and Elephant hung around, ready and willing to
assist if only told how to do things.</p>

<p>Of course much of the conversation concerned the new and strange sights
that were likely to be the portion of the Bird boys while spending the
coming weeks upon a real Southwestern cattle ranch. They brushed up their
knowledge of things supposed to be associated with cowboy life; but which
of course had been for the most part gleaned from books and the
newspapers.</p>

<p>“Ten days, and perhaps our aeroplane will be there,” Andy was saying
that evening, as he and Frank locked up, preparatory to going home; and he
had been yawning for the last hour, on account of having had so little
sleep on the preceding night. “That ought to mean we must start from here
by another week, don’t you think, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a week from tomorrow morning would be about the right time,”
replied the other, as he turned the key in the lock and tried the
door.</p>

<p>Andy chuckled.</p>

<p>“Mighty careful about that door, I see, Frank; don’t mean to take any
chances of somebody getting in our shop, like they did once
before when we had that old lock on it. But I know just three fellows who
are not thinking of trying any caper like that tonight. If you mentioned
it to them, like as not they’d shiver all over and look sick. Because they
got the scare of their lives last night. I just reckon they won’t feel
like creeping in any old dark place for a long time after this.”</p>

<p>The two cousins walked along until they came to Frank’s house when Andy
prepared to stalk off alone.</p>

<p>“Goodnight, Frank,” he said, “and here’s hoping that we get as good a
start as we gave the airship today. A week from tomorrow, you say? Well,
in the morning—” another big yawn—“we’ll have to get busy, and send
Uncle Jethro a long message, telling him when he can look for us, and to
have the agent out there keep a watch for our freight. Wow! but I’m that
sleepy I can hardly see straight. No, can’t stop over with you, because I
was away last night, you know, and mom might be worried. So-long, Frank!
See you again after breakfast, when we’ll get busy with that new drag
brake you’re working on, and which ought to work like a charm.”</p>

<p>“Call me up on the wire when you get home, Andy,” said Frank, after 
him.</p> 

<p>“Hey! d’ye think somebody’s going to try and kidnap me on the road?”
demanded the other.</p>

<p>“No; but I’m afraid you may go to sleep on the way, and keep on walking
everlastingly,” called out Frank, laughingly, and then closed the door.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='What They Found at Witherspoon' id='chV'>
CHAPTER V—WHAT THEY FOUND AT WITHERSPOON
</h2>

<p>“We’re almost there, Frank!”</p>

<p>“Yes, the next station is Witherspoon, the brakesman said. Got all your
traps ready, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve had them gathered up this half hour and more. Whee! ain’t it
hot down here, though; and won’t I be glad to get out of this stuffy
sleeper?”</p>

<p>The two cousins had made the long journey at a pretty rapid pace, and
at the time these words passed between them, were nearing the end. They
had for some time skirted deserts and mountains that looked very strange
to their Northern eyes. And when occasionally they caught fugitive
glimpses of distant herds of cattle grazing on some miles of grass lands
bordering the course of a hidden stream, naturally their thoughts went out
to what they expected to see when they had arrived at the cattle ranch of
Andy’s uncle.</p>

<p>“Uncle Jethro must be a man of some importance down this way,” Andy
went on to say, “when they go so far as to even name the station after
him.” At that Frank chuckled.</p>

<p>“Well,” he remarked, drily, “if it looks like some we’ve seen, that
isn’t paying your relative a very great honor; because they were the most
terrible tumbledown places I ever did set eyes on. But let’s hope
Witherspoon will turn out to be something different.”</p>

<p>“Frank, I do believe the train’s beginning to slacken up right now!”
cried Andy, all of a tremble with eagerness.</p>

<p>“You’re right it is and here comes our friend the brakesman to help us
off with all our truck,” observed the other Bird boy, who did not show his
excitement as much, although no doubt he too was quivering with the
anticipation of the coming introduction to Western ways.</p>

<p>Presently the train came to a stop, and the boys having reached the
platform of the sleeper stepped off.</p>

<p>As they did so there was a loud whoop from a dozen lusty throats.
Looking in the direction from whence these vociferous sounds proceeded
they saw a collection of rough and ready picturesque cowboys, just like
those who had appeared in the moving picture plays which Frank and Andy
had enjoyed from time to time in the little playhouse in Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>They were on foot, but their horses could be seen hitched
along a rail close by, and exhibiting more or less of spirit because of
the hissing engine, to which they were evidently not accustomed.</p>

<p>Frank had just shaken hands with the accommodating brakesman, and tipped
the colored porter of the sleeper, when he discovered Andy caught in the
arms of a tall man, whose snow-white mustache and goatee gave him a
distinguished appearance.</p>

<p>Of course this could be no other than Uncle Jethro. Frank knew he would
like the ranchman from the start, and that nearly everybody must. While
his word was law in that section, at the same time the owner of the ranch
was a genial gentleman, whom most of his cowboy hands thought so much of,
that they would be willing to go through fire and flood at any time to
serve him.</p>

<p>Frank at first sight thought Uncle Jethro looked like a Kentucky
Colonel; and that impression never left him.</p>

<p>“So, this is Frank Bird, is it?” exclaimed the cattleman, hurrying over
with extended hand which closed on that of the boy with a vim that made
him wince. “Well, it does my heart good to see you both. We’re going to
try and give you the time of your lives down here. Yes, your
 freight is in the house yonder, and we’re prepared to haul
it to the ranch right away. I must say I’m pleased to find you both such a
hearty looking lot. And a spell out in this free air will do you a world
of good. But won’t you come over and shake hands with my boys; they’re
just wild to meet you. For ten days, now, all the talk around here has
been of flying machines. Most of us have never seen such a thing; and
you’d laugh yourselves sick to hear the guesses that have been made about
what they look like. Most of the boys are of the opinion it’s only a big
gas balloon. Here you are, and now let me do the honors.”</p>

<p>The train had already pulled out, so that they had the little Arizona
station to themselves. One by one the cow punchers stepped up, and were
properly introduced to each of the Bird boys in turn; generally with some
little side remarks that might apply to their appearance or the name they
went by.</p>

<p>In this way the newcomers felt that they already knew considerable
about their new friends, even before they had met them five minutes.
Cowboys as a rule are not a hard lot to get acquainted with; they are
blunt and open and full of questions.</p>

<p>It could be seen that the two boys from the Far East were
objects of intense curiosity to every one of the bunch. They watched them
closely, just as though some were secretly of the opinion that Frank and
Andy might at any moment suddenly develop a pair of wings that they had up
to then kept hidden about their persons, call out a hasty goodbye, and bob
up in the air as easy as the ordinary cowpuncher would hurl himself on his
pony.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s see about getting your freight started, boys,” called out
Uncle Jethro, after this ceremony had been completed, and the newcomers
had been duly welcomed with hearty handshakes by the grinning punchers.
“You see, we fetched a big wagon along, with four horses; and likely
enough that will get the stuff out home by night. If it looks hard, I’ll
send back another lot of horses to help pull. And your trunk can go along
with you on the back of the carryall. The boys wanted to fetch mounts for
you both, but I reckoned that you might not be wholly as much at home on
the back of a pony as in your flying machine, so I drove in myself.”</p>

<p>Frank thought that was very kind and considerate of Uncle Jethro; who
must have known that the wild spirits among the cowboys would be apt to
make it a bit unpleasant for greenhorns who were unused to
their harum-scarum ways when in the saddle. Wait until they had been there
a week, and he believed that he and Andy might be able to hold their own
fairly well; for both of them had done more or less horseback riding, such
as is practiced on Eastern roads, and which must be pretty tame compared
with the dash of these reckless riders of the range.</p>

<p>The whole lot trooped after them when they accompanied the cattleman to
the little freight house. Here their precious aeroplane was found, and so
far as they were able to tell from a quick survey of the outside, not the
slightest injury had been done during its long journey. This was doubtless
due at least to the care the boys had shown in crating and boxing the
various parts; and which experience had taught them just how to go
about.</p>

<p>Amid more or less excitement and shouting the big wagon was backed up
to the door of the freight shed; and then, under the directions of Frank,
the loading began. No lack of willing hands, when every one of those
sturdy fellows seemed just wild for a chance to just touch the wonderful
flying machine, of which they had heard so many stories, most of which
they did not believe, of course; for it seemed like a yarn
from the Arabian Nights or Baron Munchausen, this idea of mere boys going
up in the air thousands of feet, in a shell of a machine, with a little
buzzing motor attached to it; or flying hundreds of miles over the wild
forests away down in South America, where they were said to have found the
long-lost father of Frank.</p>

<p>All the same, they handled the crates with more or less tenderness.
Although no doubt most of them had already decided that it was pretty much
of a fake, and that they would be a sold lot by another day, still they
were as eager as a parcel of eight year old lads to see what was coming.
Talk about the excitement that strikes an Eastern country town when the
circus arrives, it could not bear any comparison with the feverish spirit
that possessed those jostling cow punchers as they heaved and tugged and
loaded up the wagon just as Frank wanted.</p>

<p>When the last crate had been placed on top, the heavier engine being
away under all the rest, Frank saw to it that stout ropes secured the
whole. And watching just how the boy directed these things, Uncle Jethro
nodded his head toward his foreman, Waldo Kline, and winked one eye, just
as if to say, “He’ll do!”</p>

<p>Finally all seemed ready, and the horses were apparently
anxious to start on the return journey; for quite a number of miles lay
between the station where cattle were shipped, and the ranch buildings
proper.</p>

<p>Uncle Jethro last of all cautioned the driver to take his time, no
matter how long the trip seemed. Not for worlds would he have any upset
occur, or a runaway take place. If any injury were done the precious
flying machine at this stage of its long journey he would never forgive
the one responsible for the trouble. They had waited so long to see the
wonderful contraption really sail through the air that he would not answer
for what the rest of the boys would do, should they find themselves
disappointed.</p>

<p>After that it might be set down for granted that the driver would
exercise more than ordinary care in transporting the freight. If an
accident should happen the chances were he would feel like mounting a
horse immediately and putting for the railroad, to board a train, fearful
for his life.</p>

<p>Having strapped the trunk on behind the carryall in which Frank and
Andy were already seated, the joyous bunch of punchers made a rush for
their horses. The two Easterners watched eagerly to see whether the
pictures did them full justice in mounting; and on the whole
they were not in the least disappointed; for every fellow seemed to have
his own odd way of flinging himself into the saddle; and the instant the
pony felt his weight there would be an upheaval and some tall jumping
about, until the rider found his seat, and thrust his toes into the
stirrups, and from that instant he seemed to become a part of the animal
itself.</p>

<p>“Great, isn’t it, Frank? I’ve pictured that lots of times, but never
thought I’d see it with my own eyes. And they seem to be a bully bunch of
fellows, warm-hearted as the day is long; and I guess we’re going to like
it down here, all right!”</p>

<p>Frank thought just the same as Andy seemed to, even though he had not
as yet expressed himself that way. Among the dozen cow punchers they would
doubtless find a number who would become fast friends; others they might
not happen to fancy as well, perhaps on account of some peculiarities, or
it might be a retiring disposition on the part of the nomads. But first
impressions count for a lot; and it must be confessed that both of the
Bird boys were mighty well pleased with their hearty reception by the
outfit connected with the Double X Ranch. “All ready?”
called out Mr. Witherspoon; and as no one said anything to the contrary he
waved his hand to the circling boys.</p>

<p>Immediately a series of shrill “yip-yips” broke out, as the riders went
tearing off at a furious pace, to wheel presently and come charging
headlong down toward the carryall, waving their hats, and carrying on as
though possessed.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind ’em, boys,” remarked Uncle Jethro, complacently. “They’ve
just got to work off some of the surplus energy that this free life seems
to stow up in a man. You’ll be doing the same before you’re here a week,
mark my words. But I have got as fine a bunch of boys as ever threw leg
over a bucking broncho; and you’ll say as much when you get to know the
most of them. Not that they haven’t got their faults, but we overlook
small things out in this big country, you know, where the sky seems to
bend down and touch the earth all around you. Now, step lively along
there, Dexter and Silas, you ornery mules, hit up a pace!”</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='At the Double X Ranch' id='chVI'>
CHAPTER VI—AT THE DOUBLE X RANCH
</h2>

<p>The Bird Boys would not soon forget that invigorating ride. On all
sides they saw a thousand things that excited their wonder; and which they
did not hesitate to ask about. And Uncle Jethro was only too willing to
explain; he wanted these bright-faced boys who had come to visit him, to
learn all about the things with which they would come in daily contact,
and the sooner the better.</p>

<p>From this time on there would be a complete change in the air around
Frank and Andy. The talk of the cowboys was along the line of ranch life;
and by degrees many of the phrases that went to describe such things
entering into the daily life of these wild plains riders, would become
familiar to the “tenderfeet.”</p>

<p>They saw the cactus that grew along the border of the desert; the tufts
of what Uncle Jethro called “buffalo grass,” possibly because the bison
that formerly covered these same plains in countless tens of thousands
used to feed upon it; watched the queer antics of a village of prairie
dogs they passed on the way to the ranch; and heard the boys speak of a
 muddy hole as a “buffalo wallow,” though the chances were it
had been half a century since such an animal had lain down to rid himself
of the flies, by wallowing in the mud and water that came from a
rainfall.</p>

<p>Here were a few stray cattle which the rancher termed “Mavericks;” and
called to the foreman to mark down, so they could be rounded-up and
branded on the morrow; there they overtook an Indian family on the move,
with a calico horse harnessed to a couple of long drag-poles, upon which
were piled all their worldly possessions, including the squaw herself and
a dusky papoose; and once in the distance they saw a line of white-topped
wagons that gave the boys a thrill, thinking of those old days when
emigrants were in the habit of crossing the plains in such vehicles; until
Uncle Jethro kindly explained that this was a freighter’s caravan, the
prairie schooners being loaded with supplies for the mines that were
located away up in the mountains, where it was difficult to get such
material, the smelting being done on the ground, and only the pure copper
shipped out to the market.</p>

<p>It was altogether too short a ride, Andy loudly declared, when his
uncle announced that the ranch buildings were in sight ahead. He
 had seen so many new and interesting sights that he thought
he could never drink in enough of this air, heated though it might be.</p>

<p>All the same, both lads looked eagerly ahead, anxious to know what the
Double X Ranch would turn out to be like.</p>

<p>They saw a cluster of white buildings, none of them over one story in
height; and partly surrounded by green trees, that had doubtless
influenced the owner to make his headquarters in this particular spot,
where good water was to be had in abundance.</p>

<p>Already the boys had started on a gallop for the house, whooping as
usual. A genuine happy-go-lucky cow puncher is probably about the noisiest
creature on the face of the earth; he never seems to be fully satisfied
unless he is making some sort of a racket, either chasing cattle,
cavorting on his pony amidst his comrades, or shooting up a border town
when on one of his “pay-day” outings.</p>

<p>Before they reached the buildings they had drawn close enough to the
passing freight caravan for the boys to even hear the vicious crack of the
teamster’s long blacksnake whips, and to hear a choice collection of words
when some little accident happened to delay the creaking wagons a brief
time. Uncle Jethro was an old bachelor. He had a very
efficient housekeeper in a Mrs. Ogden, a middle-aged widow, whose husband
had been some sort of cousin to the owner of the ranch, and connected with
him slightly in the business, at the time he died.</p>

<p>A beaming Celestial cook, who sailed under the name of Charley Woo,
looked after the kitchen, and seemed to satisfy the demands of the
vigorous punchers. When he was out with the boys in charge of the “grub
wagon,” during their round-ups, those left at home were well taken care of
by the housekeeper herself.</p>

<p>Everything was so fine that both Andy and Frank knew they were going to
have the time of their lives; and would begrudge the days that slipped
past. They meant to soak in all the information possible, as well as show
these dashing riders that if they were greenhorns in all that was
connected with cattle punching, at least they occupied a high standard
when it came to bold exploits away up in the clouds.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day they went here and there, making fresh
discoveries at every turn, and fairly saturating themselves with the
multitude of things that were associated with this new life.</p>

<p>One of the cowboys in particular had attracted the
attention of Andy; and Frank also admitted having taken an immediate
liking for the same fellow. He was a lively boy, full of vim and go, and
yet with something winning about his ways. They called him “Buckskin,” and
it was quite a long time before either of the newcomers learned that he
had another name, Oliver Cromwell Jones.</p>

<p>He seemed more eager to hear about the exploits of the young aviators
than any of the rest; though for that matter they were every one of them
hanging around every minute they could spare from their duties, showing
the newcomers their bunkhouse, the big stables, the enclosure where the
saddle band of horses was usually kept when not in use, and everything
else they could think of, until both Andy and Frank felt that they were
growing confused under so much attention.</p>

<p>And what pleased Frank most of all was a rude building or shed which
Uncle Jethro had had built to serve as a hangar for the biplane. Where he
got his ideas from they did not know; but it must have been some magazine
article; because the affair seemed to answer all requirements; though of
course it was a mere shed, and not intended to be locked up.</p>

<p>But such a thing as injury coming to the precious
aeroplane in this isolated place never once occurred to the boys. Surely
there was no malicious Percy Carberry, and his shadow Sandy Hollingshead,
away down here to want to render the biplane worthless for use; and every
one of the punchers acted as though he believed the greatest treat of his
whole life would arrive when he actually saw with his own eyes those
daring young aviators mount upward toward the sky, until they seemed like
a mere speck in the blue vault.</p>

<p>There was one occupant of the ranch building whom the boys were pleased
indeed to meet. This was a little fairy of five, named Becky, a blue-eyed
child, daughter of a niece of Mr. Witherspoon, who had departed this life.
She was a winsome little thing, and the cow punchers seemed to fairly
worship her.</p>

<p>Frank guessed that there was a little mystery attached to her, but he
did not mean to seem curious, and ask any questions. In due time they
learned from Buckskin that this niece had run away with a dashing Mexican
named Jose Sandero; and after being cruelly treated by him, had fled once
more across the border, arriving with her tiny baby at the Double X Ranch
so worn out with fatigue that she had soon passed away. Her
child had been left to Uncle Jethro; but not wanting to risk any chances,
he had taken legal means to make himself the guardian of little Becky. And
ever since she had been the sunlight of the whole ranch. The boys would
stop in the midst of any wordy war, or wild singing, just to listen to the
music of her sweet childish voice, that seemed capable of arousing all the
best emotions in their natures.</p>

<p>Nothing had ever been seen of the father, and it was taken for granted
that he must either be dead, or never wanted to attempt to claim his
child. And, Buckskin declared that if ever he did show up round that
region, he stood the finest possible chance of pulling hemp that any man
ever knew.</p>

<p>That supper was one never to be forgotten. With the smiling Chinaman
waiting on the noisy crowd, and appeasing every demand, Andy thought he
had never enjoyed anything half so much in all his life. He had often
camped out, and eaten the fare that is so greatly relished by every
healthy lad with red blood in his veins, but there were so many things
connected with this meal at the long table, where some ten ranch riders
sat, and exchanged comments characteristic of their occupation, with
everything so strange to the tenderfoot, that it made a deep
impression on both the newcomers, never to be eradicated.</p>

<p>Then the punchers trooped off to their bunkhouse, to leave the
travelers alone, for they felt that they needed considerable of a rest to
make up for the fatigues of their long journey.</p>

<p>The man who drove the double team connected with the wagon must have
coaxed considerable speed out of them after all without meeting with any
accident on the road, for the freight had shown up an hour before sunset,
and ere the call came for supper it had all been safely stowed away in the
rude hangar, where Frank and his cousin could work at it on the
morrow.</p>

<p>It was rather early when the boys sought their comfortable little room,
where the white sheets invited them to sound slumber; and the soft night
breeze fanned their cheeks, coming through the many windows that were
always open.</p>

<p>They sat at the window some time, talking in low tones about many of
the strange things they had already seen, and speculating on how this dry
air of the desert border would affect them, when they made their first
ascension.</p>

<p>Far away the mysterious lowing of herds came faintly to their ears;
they could also catch the whinnying of horses in the
stockade; and now and then the sound of music in the shape of a deftly
manipulated accordion; or it might be the soft twanging of a Mexican
mandolin, while one of the boys warbled softly about some black-eyed
senorita he had left behind him in the country of the dons.</p>

<p>After a while the cousins decided that they ought to be in bed, and
getting rested for the labors that awaited them in the morning. And once
they threw themselves down, they were lost to the world in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>Of course they dreamed as every boy does pretty much all the time. And
it was only natural that Andy’s mind should go back while he slept to
other days, when he and Frank were engaged in the hottest of races with
their rival, Percy Carberry, who was just as deeply interested in all
matters connected with aviation as they had been.</p>

<p>Many a time had they found themselves compelled to sit up and guard
their property when they had by some successful exploit aroused the worse
elements in the jealous nature of this rival. And even now, though removed
from the home town and Percy by several thousand miles, Andy had to dream
that once again a dark cloud was hovering over their
fortunes, and all caused by the hatred of this boy who for more than two
years had been the one thorn in their flesh.</p>

<p>So vivid had been his dream that Andy actually suddenly awoke with a
low cry, and sat up in bed, trembling all over.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Frank, also springing up.</p>

<p>Before Andy could frame any sort of answer, owing to the confusion of
ideas that seemed to be tumbling pell mell through his brain, both of them
were thrilled to hear a voice from somewhere outside shouting:</p>

<p>“Wake up! help! help! fire! Whoop! get busy there, fellows!”</p>

<p>As though governed by a couple of springs the cousins leaped from their
comfortable bed, and rushing over to one of the windows that looked toward
where the new shed covering the precious aeroplane stood, they saw a sight
that thrilled as well as alarmed them.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='A Pretty Close Call' id='chVII'>
CHAPTER VII—A PRETTY CLOSE CALL
</h2>

<p>“Oh! it’s our hangar on fire!” gasped Andy.</p>

<p>“Quick, get into something then, and out we go!” cried Frank, always
the prompt one to act in an emergency.</p>

<p>Andy hardly knew how he ever did manage to drag on a pair of trousers,
and his shoes. His hands were shaking so he could hardly do what he aimed
to accomplish; and all the while the shouts were increasing in violence,
as well as that terrible light growing brighter.</p>

<p>By the time he had managed to get the second shoe on, Frank was already
outside; and having seen how easily the other jumped through the window to
the ground, Andy hastened to follow his example.</p>

<p>Already there was a group of the punchers at work; and the clear
commanding tones of Mr. Witherspoon’s voice could be heard telling them
just what to do. Fortunately it had always been a set principle of the
rancher to prepare for war in time of peace, and he had a drilled fire
department, with the hose and extinguisher handy.</p>

<p>Every fellow knew just where he fitted in; and perhaps it
was this very system that prevented much damage being done. Instead of
great confusion, with each eager fire-fighter getting in the way of the
others, and nothing worth while being accomplished, the genius at the head
of the combination saw that every man occupied the place that had been
laid out for him.</p>

<p>And when several chemical fire extinguishers started to get busy, it
was a losing fight with that conflagration; though possibly had it been
given another quarter of an hour in which to get a firm grip on the
contents of the shed, there must have been a far different story to
tell.</p>

<p>All this while the boys seemed to feel their hearts choking them with
burning anxiety. What if after all their precious aeroplane should be
injured after so successfully passing through the perils of that long
journey! It was like a slap in the face, as Andy termed it.</p>

<p>And it may be readily understood that, when the water with which that
end of the long shed had thoroughly drenched the last spark of fire, so
that it was safe to enter, they hurried in alongside Uncle Jethro, who was
breathing all sorts of bitterness toward the one whose carelessness had
brought about this accident, both Frank and his cousin were
in a feverish state of suspense.</p>

<p>Eagerly they made the rounds escorted by the equally anxious Buckskin
and the other range riders. It was almost pitiful to see how these usually
loud voiced fellows now had not a whisper to spare; but just watched the
faces of the young aviators, and waited to hear the verdict.</p>

<p>And then, when finally the rounds had been made, and Frank gave it as
his opinion that no damage worth mentioning had come about, it seemed as
though the very roof of that shed would be fairly lifted from its supports
by the volume of the lusty shouts that soared upwards from the
leather-lined throats of Buckskin and his companions.</p>

<p>Those who had been slightly burned in fighting the blaze went around
showing the red marks with the pride that a warrior might in his scars of
battle; and the forlorn chaps who had come off unscathed felt sorry
because they had not seen to it that they secured their share of the hall
marks of fame when they had the chance.</p>

<p>Each cowboy had to line up and shake hands with Frank and Andy, while
he offered congratulations on the lucky outcome of what at
one time had threatened to be a national misfortune. And they looked as
happy over it as though some rich uncle had suddenly stepped off, leaving
them a fortune; or a big cattle ranch, which is the cowboy conception of
great good luck.</p>

<p>But Mr. Witherspoon was not so easily satisfied. That fire had not
started of its own account. Either some one had been exceedingly careless,
criminally so, or else there was a mystery back of its happening; and he
meant to know which of the two possibilities was the truth.</p>

<p>So he started an investigation right on the spot, with the half-clad
punchers brought up before him one after the other. It was easily proven
who had been last at the shed; but this was one of the oldest and most
reliable of the force, a man by the name of Steady Matt; and he declared
that when he left the new building it was perfectly safe, nor had he seen
a single match struck by a cowboy while there—this being one of the
little fads of the rancher, who was next door to a crank concerning the
careless use of matches about the place.</p>

<p>“Now, the boys, they seem to reckon, Mr. Witherspoon, that it might
a-been the work of an outside party; leastwise, that’s what they
 say,” remarked Buckskin, when the examination seemed about
to end, without any one being a bit the wiser.</p>

<p>“Oh! is that so, Buckskin?” ejaculated the rancher, looking immediately
interested. “Suppose you tell me, then, what they are talking about. We’ve
had our little differences with Major Cloud and his Circle Ranch crowd;
but I wouldn’t want to think any man who ever threw a leg over a pony’s
back, or snapped a quirt as he rounded up cattle, could be guilty of such
a nasty job as trying to burn a neighbor’s buildings.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t them, Mr. Witherspoon,” the puncher went on to say, earnestly,
as he slapped his leather chaps with the stick he held; “p’raps Rustler
Carlos’d fill the bill more like, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t put such a job past that sneak one minute,” declared
the rancher, promptly, “and he certainly has plenty of cause to hate me,
after the way we took that bunch of stolen long-horns away from him last
spring, and gave him a close call before he could cross the border into
Mexico. But he hasn’t been heard of around here since then; so it must be
only a wide guess you boys are making. But I’d a thousand times rather
think that, than have a man in my employ be careless, or
ready to play a low-down trick like that.”</p>

<p>“If we thought it was done a purpose, Mr. Witherspoon, and could find
out the feller that done it, there’d be some queer fruit a-growin’ on one
of them telegraph poles along the Santa Fe railroad; ain’t it so, boys?”
and the indignant Buckskin turned around upon the cluster of listening
hustlers.</p>

<p>The instantaneous shout of wild approval that greeted these words would
have convinced any listener of the evident sincerity of the group. If
there was one among them who had yielded to any sort of temptation, it was
evident that he could not be easily persuaded to make a second attempt.
But after all, it seemed silly to think such a thing could be true; when
the Bird boys did not have an enemy down here in this new country, where
every one had been an utter stranger until now.</p>

<p>“But let’s forget all about it,” said Frank, at this juncture. “Not a
speck of harm has been done, and we’re as sure that no one here would
dream of trying to injure our machine as we are that we draw breath.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Frank!” shouted one of the punchers; and of course
another wild cheer had to allow some of the pent-up
enthusiasm to break loose.</p>

<p>Had any one been passing along the trail that led to the mines, and
which ran about a mile from the ranch buildings, and heard all this clamor
at dead of night, he must have been greatly puzzled to account for the
racket; and possibly think that the Double X outfit were making a night of
it with good cheer.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing sure,” said Uncle Jethro, positively, “after this
we’re not going to let this flying machine of yours, boys, lie unguarded.
I leave it to my foreman, Waldo Kline, here, to see that it holds safe;
and he’ll be accountable to me for it.”</p>

<p>“Wow! we’ll all camp around it, if so be he says the word!” cried
Buckskin, with a look toward his chums, which brought out encouraging
comments.</p>

<p>“Come on back to the house, Frank and Andy,” remarked the rancher, “and
you can just as well make up your minds that after this no piece of
property was ever so jealously guarded as your machine will be. I’m sorry
for the wretch that tried to do it any injury after this. He’ll sure
believe he’s run up against the biggest hurricane ever, the way those boys
will rustle him.” And Frank believed him.</p>

<p>He went back deeply thankful that no harm had befallen the aeroplane
before it made its maiden trip in those Arizona hot airs; and yet puzzled
to account for the fire.</p>

<p>“Do you really think it was an accident, Frank?” asked Andy, when they
found themselves once more alone in their little room.</p>

<p>“Ask me something easy, won’t you?” replied the other, as he prepared
to crawl into bed again. “I wish I did know the truth, because I don’t
like this thing of suspecting any fellow, when he may be as innocent as
you and me. But honest now, I can’t bring myself to believe that it was an
accident.”</p>

<p>“Well, there may be something in that story about the Mexican they call
Rustler Carlos,” Andy went on to say. “Buckskin was telling me some things
about his doings around this region some years back. He cut a pretty wide
swathe, they say; and in his many ‘drives’ carried off hundreds of fat
cattle across the border into Mexico, where it wasn’t safe for Americans
to go, because they sort of hate Gringoes down there, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand,” Frank added, “and just as Uncle Jethro said, he
was the first to really break up this fine and profitable rustler
 business of the cattle thieves. This Carlos must hate him
with all the fury his breed can show. And if he ever did have nerve enough
to run up this way again, I guess he’d be glad to try and do the Double X
Ranch people a rough turn, if he saw the chance. But perhaps we’ll know
more about this thing some time later.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Andy went on to say, a little vindictively, for he had been much
worked up over the threatened destruction of the planes and woodwork of
the aeroplane; “and if this Rustler Carlos should happen around again, I
reckon it’ll be hardly worth mentioning what they won’t do to him. I never
saw fellows madder than these boys seem to be right now. And Frank, I kind
of think they’ve taken a great liking to you, on so short an
acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“Better say yourself, Andy,” retorted the other immediately; “because
everybody nearly does, that meets you. Now roll over, and quit thinking
about the thing. It’s all right, and no damage done, so go to sleep like a
good fellow. You won’t get a single word out of me, I warn you.”</p>

<p>And Andy knowing that his cousin meant it did proceed to chase all
thoughts of the recent excitement from his mind, so that he might
 settle down again into a sound sleep, for it seemed that
midnight had no more than passed, so that a long period still remained
before the coming of dawn awoke them.</p>

<p>There was no further alarm.</p>

<p>Doubtless that cordon of slumbering cowboys lying around the new shed
formed so close a protection, that even a wandering rattlesnake could
hardly have passed the line without being challenged.</p>

<p>And when Frank opened his eyes again, the light of day was shining in
through the two windows facing the east; so that, hearing sounds that told
of breakfast being made ready, he gave Andy a kick, telling him to bestir
himself, if he hoped to start the day rightly by appearing at early
breakfast with the rest of the Double X outfit.</p>

<h2 title='The Broncho Buster Meets His Match' id='chVIII'>
CHAPTER VIII—THE BRONCHO BUSTER MEETS HIS MATCH
</h2>

<p>Such a busy day as they put in.</p>

<p>It was hard for the foreman to influence the cow-punchers to look after
their customary avocations, for they wanted to be hanging around that
hangar all the time, watching Frank and Andy assemble the various queer
parts of the delicate contraption that, when completed would be called a
biplane.</p>

<p>The idea that any one would dare trust himself in such a little
contrivance, and soar like the white-headed eagle away up above the
clouds, staggered the belief of these fellows; all of whom wanted to be
“shown” before they would be willing to admit that such a wonderful thing
could ever come to pass.</p>

<p>They looked on the Bird boys with almost reverence. Such pluck and
daring outdistanced their own reckless horseback plunging as far as the
sun outshines the yellow moon.</p>

<p>Some of them tried their very best to make themselves useful, and even
pleaded with the boys to think up some way in which they could “run and
fetch,” so that the foreman would excuse them from going out on the range
after stray mavericks, or rounding up bunches of cattle that
may have strayed toward the dangerous coulies of the mountains, where all
sorts of danger would await them.</p>

<p>But as they needed no assistance whatever, Frank had to shake his head,
even to the persistent Buckskin, for he knew that if he favored one it
would create bad feeling among the rest and this was something to be
avoided, so early in their acquaintance with these warm-hearted but
impulsive cattle punchers.</p>

<p>When noon came the aeroplane was taking shape, and beginning to look
like something. A little help was needed when it came to installing the
motive power; but there was plenty to be had; in a pinch even the grinning
Charley Woo would have been willing to lend a hand; although he had
privately announced it as his opinion that if this wonderful affair, that
looked so much like the big box-kites flown in his native country, could
sail away above the clouds, they would never set eyes on the two bold
young navigators again; and he also said that Mr. Witherspoon ought to
keep control of the flying machine by means of a rope, so that he could
pull it down when he thought best.</p>

<p>It was really wonderful how quickly all the boys got through with their
jobs on this particular day. Where under ordinary conditions
they would not have shown up at the ranch house until evening, they now
came galloping in like mad by two o’clock, and before three had arrived
not a single puncher was out on the range.</p>

<p>Mr. Witherspoon smiled and nodded his head good-naturedly when he
noticed this significant fact.</p>

<p>“Already your coming has borne fruit, you see,” he remarked to Frank;
“and if it keeps up we’re going to have the greatest lot of hustlers here
at the Double X Ranch you ever heard tell of. They can do things like
lightning these days. And look at the way they hang around, just devouring
both of you boys with stares. I guess you’ve got them locoed for a fact,”
and when Frank, who wanted to know what everything meant, stopped him
right there to ask for an explanation, the obliging rancher told how there
was a certain weed known as the loco, which, when cattle indulged in it,
made them crazy for a time, so that they were apt to rush into streams and
be drowned, or pitch pell mell over precipices in their blindness and
excitement.</p>

<p>About four o’clock Frank announced that everything was ready for the
first ascent and the feverish punchers could hardly contain
themselves. It needed only a word to get them to do anything that was
required; for the time being they were ready to act as slaves, if by so
doing they could hasten developments.</p>

<p>There was a splendid level stretch upon which the first run could be
made; indeed, that was one beauty of aeroplaning on the plains, where
difficulties would not be met with in landing, or making an ascent.</p>

<p>Frank gave the signal, and willing hands assisted in starting the
strange affair with its box-like wings. Charley Woo hid behind a pile of
crate material as though really fearing that the spirits of the air might
be offended by this bold invasion, and start to visit their vengeance on
the whole lot who had assisted in the work.</p>

<p>But the cowboys jumped for their horses, and mounting like a flash,
started to gallop after the young aviators, fully expecting that they
would have the mournful office of gathering up their remains, and
transporting them back to the ranch house.</p>

<p>Judge of their astonishment and wild delight when they saw the
aeroplane leave the earth, take a turn upward when the forward plane was
elevated, and start in the direction of the few fleecy,
floating white clouds that hovered overhead.</p>

<p>How they yelled and shrieked and pranced about as though they had
really and truly lost their heads. And then, gathering in a bunch they
watched the wonderful evolutions which those skilful air pilots put their
willing steed through, as thoroughly entranced as though they had been put
under the magic power of a wizard.</p>

<p>Frank was not taking unnecessary chances. He wanted to know the
conditions of this new country before attempting any of the more difficult
maneuvers which he and Andy were accustomed to carrying out in their home
circles, where they understood the wind and its peculiarities to a
dot.</p>

<p>But the most simple trick was greeted with hoarse shouts by that
cluster of eager watchers below. And when the young aviators began to bore
up and up in circle until they were fully six thousand feet high, the
amazed and delighted spectators almost broke their necks staring after
them, afraid lest they miss a part of the spectacle if they so much as
turned away for a single instant.</p>

<p>Then again they came circling down in great loops, while the little
gathering near the ranch house stood and gaped and wondered
if they were really awake, or passing through a vivid dream of
enchantment.</p>

<p>The conditions being favorable, Frank gave his companion due warning as
to what he was about to do, and then started to volplane downward.
Immediately cries of horror broke out from those intrepid range riders,
who naturally believed something must have broken aboard the aeroplane,
and that the Bird Boys were now being hurled to earth, from which they
would later on be picked up lifeless.</p>

<p>When they saw the flying machine suddenly recover a level position, and
with the merry hum of the motor start again to spin along, about two
hundred feet above their heads, the punchers fell into each others’ arms,
as though too weak to stand up any longer.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Frank brought his aerial steed to a landing just at
the very point where he had taken his departure half an hour before; and
so lightly did the heavier-than-air machine settle that it seemed as
though an egg could hardly have been broken by the impact, had it come
between.</p>

<p>They were immediately overwhelmed with warm congratulations because of
the marvelous work they had done while aloft. It had been
 only the common, every-day experience of Frank and Andy; but
in the eyes of these untamed Western spirits was wonderful beyond
compare.</p>

<p>“Here’s Buckskin been boasting that if you boys could go up, he guessed
he could too. Take him for a little airing, Frank. Let him make good, or
shut up!” one of the cowboys exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Would you like to try a little spin, Buckskin; Andy here will make way
for you if you say the word?” Frank asked.</p>

<p>Now, the aforesaid Buckskin would have instantly declined but they had
him in a hole, where he must take water, or else put on a bold front. And
as a cowboy invariably hates to back down, once he has made his boast, he
tried to look quite indifferent as he replied:</p>

<p>“Sure I’d like to take a little turn of a dozen miles or two with you,
Frank, if you’ll ask me. I ain’t had no experience in ridin’ one of them
cantankerous mounts; but they can’t find a broncho able to throw me; and
who’s afraid, anyhow? Tell me what to do, and show me how to do it, and
I’m there all to the good, and wool a yard wide.”</p>

<p>So Andy climbed down, and the cowboy, sheepskin chaps and all, took his
place. He made out to be utterly at his ease; and it was
only Frank who knew from personal contact just how Buckskin was trembling
all the while.</p>

<p>“All you have to do is to sit perfectly still; and don’t offer to do
anything to help me. If I want any assistance I’ll sing out for it,” was
the way the pilot of the biplane laid down the law; and Buckskin promised
faithfully that he would adhere to the rules of the game to the
letter.</p>

<p>The start was made just as perfectly as before, and then Frank began to
perform a number of simple evolutions before making a try for
altitude.</p>

<p>The dazed cowboy may have had a smile on his face all the while, but it
was of the kind that won’t come off, virtually frozen there. He clutched
the seat with rigid fingers, and stared out straight to where in the
distance he could see the summit of Mount Baker, said to be seven thousand
feet high, but which he believed was far below his lofty eyrie.</p>

<p>Once, when he did catch faint yells from the crowd so far below him,
Buckskin mustered up assurance enough to take off his hat, and wave it
several times; but never once would he look straight down toward where the
others were cheering him to the echo. When finally, after a
whole lot of turning, until his senses fairly reeled, he heard Frank say
that they were nearly through, the scared cowboy regained courage enough
to send a sickly grin down at his comrades. Of course Frank would not
think of volplaning with a greenhorn aboard, as the chances were, he would
take fright and either leap out under the impression that they were bound
to have a smash-up anyhow, or else make some frantic move that would
endanger the very lives of both occupants of the biplane.</p>

<p>And so they landed as neatly as any pilot of an air craft could
possibly do. The relieved Buckskin almost dazed, managed to drop from his
perch, his hands to be warmly shaken by his chums, while they assured him
that he had done the whole outfit proud by his recent gallant act.</p>

<p>But it might have been noticed that Buckskin never again ventured to
accompany either one of the Bird boys aloft. He vowed that it was the
finest experience he had ever known, and one that he would not have missed
for a fortune; but all the same, he knew when he had had enough; and the
other fellows could try their hands at copying the old eagle, if they
wished; the land was good enough for him, all right. After
the business of the day had been completed the aeroplane was once more
successfully stowed away in its handy hangar, which was amply large enough
to accommodate it even when the planes were extended.</p>

<p>It was just at this time Mr. Witherspoon beckoned Frank and Andy to
cross over to where he was standing, having come out of the house.</p>

<p>“Please give me a few minutes of your time, boys,” he said gravely,
“something has happened since you went up that seems to possibly throw a
light on what happened last night,” and a minute later, as the three sat
down in his little office or den, the genial rancher went on to remark,
“tell me, was the name of that evil genius of yours, who tried all he
could to injure you two, Percy Carberry, or something like that?”</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='Figuring It All Out' id='chIX'>
CHAPTER IX—FIGURING IT ALL OUT
</h2>

<p>“What’s that you say, Uncle Jethro?” exclaimed Andy, his face wreathed
in an expression of sheer astonishment; for it gave him a tremendous shock
to hear that nightmare of a name, Percy, mentioned away out here in
Arizona.</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” the rancher went on, “you said something to me about a
scamp who was forever trying to do you both an ill turn up around home;
and unless I’m mistaken, you also told me he was the only son of a wealthy
but foolish widow, who supplied him with all the money he asked for. The
first name was Percy, that I’d swear; and the last one began with the
letters C-a-r, now didn’t it, boys?”</p>

<p>“Carberry, that’s it, uncle,” burst out Andy.</p>

<p>“But what makes you ask that, sir?” demanded Frank, looking curiously
at what seemed to be a scrap of paper in the fingers of the gentleman.</p>

<p>“This is what made me mention it; it is apparently a small part of a
letter that some one at this place must have received not a great while
back, and which he thought best to destroy; but one of the
fragments lodged in a bush; and when my foreman chanced to notice it, and
idly picked it up, he was interested in the few words he could make out,
so he brought it to me. Here, take a look for yourselves, boys, and tell
me what you think.”</p>

<p>On the piece of paper with the ragged edges there could only be made
out some dozen or two words; a portion of these being incomplete, though
easily guessed.</p>

<p>These ran irregularly, and might be set down in something like the
following order: “Fifty dolla—good job of it—anyway you like—burn it to
cinde—hear how it—ld friend, Percy Car——”</p>

<p>Andy nearly had a fit when he read this; Frank, on his part, felt the
blood boil within him, though better able to conceal the state of his
feelings, or rather control his temper, than his impulsive cousin.</p>

<p>“Why, just think of that, would you?” exclaimed Andy, “not satisfied
with doing everything in his power to injure the Bird Boys while they were
up there, this contemptible ingrate actually has the nerve to write to
some fellow who, he happened to know, was working on or near this ranch,
and sent him fifty dollars, which was to pay him for doing something
 to make all our journey down here useless—he even put it in
his head to burn our aeroplane, and all that! Oh! he is certainly the
meanest fellow that ever came down the pike. I almost wish we’d left him
up there on the summit of Old Thunder-Top, Frank, to get what he
deserved.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I wouldn’t say that, Andy,” remarked his cousin, “it’s a rough
deal, I know, but when we could save those fellows it was our duty to do
it, no matter whether they were of any use in the world or not. You never
can tell how things are going to turn out.”</p>

<p>“You nearly always can when Percy Carberry has got to do with it,”
grumbled Andy.</p>

<p>“Now, suppose you enlighten me as to what all this talk is about,”
demanded the rancher. “Am I to understand that you once saved the very
life of this boy, who is right now doing his level best to play you a mean
trick?”</p>

<p>And so between them the boys had to relate the story, which has been
given in an earlier volume of this series, how they started in a desperate
race with Andy for the crown of the rocky height not many miles away from
Bloomsbury, away up in New York State; and a storm of wind coming up, the
aeroplane of Andy was wrecked, so that he might have even lost his
 life, only that the Bird Boys managed to hold on to him; and
afterwards get the two boys, one at a time, safely to the ground.</p>

<p>“Of all the cases of base ingratitude, that beats everything,” declared
the indignant rancher; and he forthwith set out to call every puncher and
employee on the place around him; after which he told the story and while
they listened in breathless wonder he went on to say, angrily:</p>

<p>“If there chances to be any one within the sound of my voice who
received that letter, which I can hardly believe, I want to give him fair
warning right now, that if the slightest harm comes to either of these
brave boys while they are visiting at Double X Ranch, or if any further
attempt is made to injure their airship, the punchers of this outfit have
my hearty consent to carry out their own sweet will; yes, and by thunder!
under certain conditions, I’d be willing to help pull on the rope!”</p>

<p>A salvo of cheers interrupted his words. Apparently they had found an
echo in every heart. But then Frank knew very well that if the guilty one
were present, it would be only good policy on his part to shout just as
loud as the rest, for fear lest suspicion be directed in his quarter.
 A short time later he saw Buckskin beckoning to him.
Several of the other boys seemed to be clustered around him, as though
they had been comparing notes.</p>

<p>“You see, Frank,” began Buckskin, when the other joined the group,
“none of us boys feel quite right on ’count of the way Mr. Witherspoon
said that same. It kinder made us feel oneasy like. We kept a-lookin’ at
each other, just like we was a wonderin’ whether it could be this one, or
that other night wrangler. Why, all of us feel meaner nor a mule skinner
about the same. And we’ve got together in a bunch to talk it over, so’s to
larn who it was got a letter from the East lately; and we struck pay dirt
right away.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” said Frank, “though I hope it isn’t going to make
trouble for any fellow on the pay roll of Double X Ranch.”</p>

<p>Buckskin grinned.</p>

<p>“That’s where he played it fine,” he said. “Member the slim chap you
met yesterday when you landed, and who went by the name of Parsons? Well,
he gave notice as he’d been called back home, and had to quit here last
night; so off he goes late in the afternoon, bag and baggage. None of us
seemed to cotton to him much, though, as a puncher he knew his
 business all right, and was fair spoken enough. But there
always seemed to be something slick about him that stood us off. Now,
several of us, on comparing notes, chances to remember that the Parson he
had a letter from East somewhere only a few days back. Looky here, Frank,
did you ever know anybody up in your town by the name of Edmondson;
because that was his real name, Collins Edmondson it was, though we always
called him Parson because he was so solemn like.”</p>

<p>Frank looked at his cousin, who was also of the group.</p>

<p>“That is certainty the name of his uncle; over in Rahway,” declared
Andy, “yes, and I remember hearing that name Collins before. I guess
you’ve struck pay dirt this time, Buckskin. And I’m glad, for one, that
now we know no man on this ranch would be guilty of such a mean game as
setting our machine on fire.”</p>

<p>Buckskin was immensely pleased with the remarkable results of his
figuring, and detective work. He hastened over to tell Mr. Witherspoon all
about it; and soon afterward the rancher was seen to wring his hand until
he undoubtedly made the tears come in to the stunted cow-puncher’s
eyes.</p>

<p>Great was the indignation among the rest of the boys when
they learned what appeared to be the probable truth. Some of them were
making hurriedly for their horses, muttering under their breath; and Mr.
Witherspoon had to do some quick hustling in order to cut the threatening
mutiny off.</p>

<p>“Let the snake go, boys,” he said. “He didn’t carry out his
contemptible scheme, after all, thanks to your promptness and bravery. I
give you permission that if ever he shows his head around these diggings
again, which isn’t likely, you can treat him to a nice warm coat, even if
you have to borrow my tar kettle, and steal one of my best down pillows.
That goes, boys; so just turn back now.”</p>

<p>Which the impulsive ones did, knowing that the rancher was a man of his
word, and evidently did not want the affair carried any further. But
doubtless they would manage to get word to the Parson, if so be he had
found employment anywhere in the country, that unless he felt cold, and
wanted a splendid down coat applied, regardless of cost, he would be wise
to keep away from Double X Ranch.</p>

<p>Andy begged that scrap of paper from his uncle. He declared he meant to
keep it carefully and compare the writing with some of Percy Carberry’s
later on; and if this convicted him, he would throw the
matter up to him right on the school campus in the presence of a score of
the higher scholars, and spread his proofs before them, so that they could
let the cur know what they thought of his mean actions.</p>

<p>Andy could be a good hater when he had occasion for it; he always
declared that he had a strain of good old Scotch blood in him that rose to
the surface every now and then.</p>

<p>“Seems to me that lets Rustler Carlos out of it,” remarked Buckskin,
turning to some of the others with a wide grin, a little later, when he
came back feeling tenderly of his digits, that had a pinched look, where
they had lain in the tremendous grip of the rancher.</p>

<p>“Well,” said another puncher, an old fellow called “Shorty,” though he
was six feet in height, “he’d be guilty of anything just as bad, if so be
he happened around; and for one I’m a-goin’ to keep my eyes skinned for
signs of him. Some say he crossed the line again below here fifty miles,
and made a swoop through the Underwood section; but that report has been
denied, and none of us know what to believe. So it stands to reason we
ought to keep on guard, and remember that Carlos, he don’t hold our crowd
in high esteem.”</p>

<p>The boys felt in splendid spirits as night came on again.
Apparently, now, all clouds had rolled by, and they ought to have clear
sailing after this. There were dozens of other thrills they were holding
back in store for future exhibitions; for the Bird Boys had already
learned that secret of exhibitors to always keep the best in reserve.</p>

<p>On special invitation from the boys they went over to the bunk house
that night and spent the time with them, listening to stories of thrilling
interest connected with the wild life of the desert trails, and the
valleys among the mountains in that strip of Arizona, most singular of all
the States in the Union in its many sharp contrasts with regard to the
rock strata and mineral formations.</p>

<p>In return, Frank and Andy told in a modest way something of the many
exploits in which they had been concerned as air voyagers. Most of all,
the punchers wanted to hear about how they had gone down to South America,
and found Frank’s missing father a prisoner in a cliff-enclosed valley,
into which he had fallen at the time his runaway balloon drifted far to
the south from the Panama Peninsula, when he was conducting a series of
experiments, and explorations in the interest of the great
 Northern college with which his name had long been connected
as a scientist.</p>

<p>Andy was not so backward as his cousin about telling of what wonderful
things they had seen, and how close to death they had been on numerous
occasions; he even took advantage of the opportunity to describe how often
Frank’s splendid nerve had been the only thing that had kept them from
instant destruction; and although the other tried to make light of the
facts, those hardy cow-punchers realized that in this slender stripling,
who was so modest, and yet so self-possessed, they saw as true a hero as
ever had his name recorded in the annals of history.</p>

<h2 title='Learning the Ropes on a Ranch' id='chX'>
CHAPTER X—LEARNING THE ROPES ON A RANCH
</h2>

<p>The days began to just glide away, and every one saw Frank and Andy
finding new sources of keen enjoyment.</p>

<p>They seldom lost a day for a while but that they went up for a short
time, at least, in the aeroplane that was the marvel and admiration of the
whole ranch. Those who worked on other cattle ranges were no longer
startled when they saw a strange object not unlike a monstrous bird come
spinning overhead, and disappearing in the distance. Though they never
failed to stop their work, no matter what that might be, and gape upwards,
as long as the aeroplane remained in sight, still, they no longer fired at
it, as happened at first.</p>

<p>The boys had been warned by Uncle Jethro in the beginning that in
making their flights miles away from home they would be wise to keep a
pretty considerable distance aloft. There was never any telling what
cowboys would do; and they were so apt to empty their guns at what they
fancied must be some queer bird belonging to the supposed to be extinct
class. At any rate, the warning was heeded, and on numerous
occasions Frank and Andy believed that they profited from it. Indeed, it
seemed to be the usual thing, whenever they passed over a cowboy in some
strange section of the country, for him to whip out his gun and empty it;
after which he would sometimes dodge, and try to conceal himself under a
tree, or a clump of sage brush, or it might be a sentinel cactus ten feet
high, growing on the border of the desert.</p>

<p>But by degrees the news was circulating around that this was one of the
new fangled aeroplanes, and the shooting began to grow less frequent,
though the young aviators did not take more chances than they could
help.</p>

<p>Frequently, now, there would be company at the ranch and bunk house. In
fact, these days Double X Ranch was fast becoming the Mecca for the entire
neighborhood. Whenever a party of punchers got a holiday, instead of going
off to town to indulge in a booze, they would start over to see the
“wonder of the air,” and hope that the young pilots of the upper currents
would perform for them.</p>

<p>This got to be such a nuisance that finally Frank had to announce that
they were only going up on certain days, when the exhibition would be
free. And at such times there was sure to be quite a crowd
present, all wild to see how this queer steed that flew through the air at
the rate of from forty to eighty miles an hour, or even a full hundred on
occasion, was managed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two boys had been singularly fortunate, in that they
did not meet with a single serious accident. Outside of the intense heat
they had little of a disagreeable nature to contend with in this Arizona
climate, where winds did not often visit the lowlands in great force, and
a dead calm usually prevailed. And as soon as they were aloft, they found
the atmosphere decidedly cool, even cold, since they were quickly free
from the earth’s radiation.</p>

<p>Of course, they had scoured the immediate country, and even ventured a
short way out over the desert, dropping low enough to observe the strange
formation of the billows of sand that reminded them of the sea, note the
peculiarities that marked the tall cactus plants; and make up their minds
that there could be a great many more pleasant things happen to them than
getting lost on this burning stretch, with little or no water to quench
their raging thirst.</p>

<p>After the first glimpse of that waste stretch, the boys always made
sure to carry a big bottle of water along with them when starting out. And
Uncle Jethro declared that it was a wise precaution, as they
could never tell when such a thing might prove to be a life preserver, if
not for themselves, then possibly in the case of another who had
unfortunately lost himself on the desert, and whose plight they might
discover from aloft.</p>

<p>But while they scoured the level in this fashion, the boys were
cautious about trying to fly over the rugged elevations to the north,
where the mines were being operated, to which the trains of wagons
containing supplies headed so frequently.</p>

<p>They found just as they expected, that the winds were apt to be
contrary in this region, and that it was more or less dangerous to attempt
to fly where at any minute a furious gust would suddenly strike the
aeroplane on the right quarter; which was hardly guarded against, when a
second rush of air would swoop down from still another angle, threatening
to overturn the sprawling flier with its violence.</p>

<p>One visit in this direction was enough for them, and on this occasion
they saw the mouth of one of the mines, with a curious group standing as
usual gazing upward in open-mouthed wonder.</p>

<p>Those mountains presented a grim aspect that impressed both the boys
exceedingly, and they would never forget the sight. Andy had
brought a new kodak, which his father had purchased in order that they
might carry back something to show the folks at home. It was small in
size, but with an expensive lens; and capable of producing very fine
pictures; so that they hoped to have a display worth looking at by the
time these were all developed and prints made later on.</p>

<p>Nothing that was interesting escaped Andy, and he had developed quite a
liking for his new occupation, being constantly on the lookout for scenes
that he thought would make good prints.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that all this time the Bird Boys were so
much occupied with scouring the regions of the upper air for fifty or a
hundred miles in every direction, that they neglected to take advantage of
the opportunities presented to observe what life on a great cattle ranch
was like, for this was not so.</p>

<p>As time passed they limited their flights more and more, having
discovered other sources of amusement that held their interest; because by
this time flying no longer possessed the novelty for them that it had in
the beginning; and once they had exhausted the new sights of the region,
they were not so anxious to go up as they were to mount
ponies, and see something of life with the cow punchers.</p>

<p>By degrees they were learning a great many things that they had never
dreamed would ever fall to their lot. Being young, and quick to pick up
new “stunts,” both of them gave promise of soon making average riders, at
least, though they might not hope to equal some of the punchers who were
more reckless by nature, and handled their mounts as though a cayuse were
a machine, governed by their sole whim.</p>

<p>Both Frank and Andy had their own ponies, and could dash like mad over
the level, plying both voice and quirt in the endeavor to come in ahead;
for cowboys spend much of their time in this sort of racing.</p>

<p>They had adopted something of the dress of the others, and even wore
the customary “chaps” made of leather and handsomely decorated, and to
which they soon became accustomed in spite of the first awkward
feeling.</p>

<p>And so, daily they were seeing more and more of life on the range. They
visited the prairie dog village and shot rattlers that were dozing outside
the holes in which they lived at peace with the queer little animals that
amused Andy so, and which he stalked on the sly, so as to
take home some pictures of them.</p>

<p>They learned to throw a rope with a fair degree of skill, although this
takes long practice, if one wishes to become an expert. Neither of them
ever actually threw a cow, though they believed they would be able to do
so in time, if they kept this thing up long enough.</p>

<p>They did like to watch the regular punchers do the trick and get the
rope around the snubbing post like lightning every time. Both Frank and
Andy could hobble a broncho equal to the next one; and on one occasion had
spent a night on the range “wrangling” horses, which meant that they kept
company with the guard whose duty was to watch the precious saddle band,
and prevent them from straying, which catastrophe would be apt to leave
the party without mounts for their morrow’s work; and this is really the
worst thing that could happen to cowboys, who seldom walk if they can help
it.</p>

<p>Later on there was to be the regular fall round-up, and the boys
expected to be able to accompany the outfit, and see the youngsters
branded after the most approved fashion, with Andy capturing numerous
pictures that would show just how the entire operation were carried out.
 One evening while the two boys were sitting with Mr.
Witherspoon on the big verandah which was kept screened to prevent an
onslaught from insect pests, the genial rancher surprised Frank and Andy
by casually remarking:</p>

<p>“I rather think, now, that we’ll have a decent day for our little
expedition tomorrow; and that the heat will be somewhat less pronounced
than usual.”</p>

<p>Andy looked at his cousin. Uncle Jethro had already sprung several
little surprises on them and seemed to enjoy it immensely so that they
immediately scented something new.</p>

<p>“What sort of trip is that, Uncle?” asked Andy, seeing that the rancher
was waiting to be questioned.</p>

<p>He pretended to be surprised, and raised his eyebrows as he
remarked:</p>

<p>“Oh! is it possible that I forgot to mention to you that I’ve arranged
to take you on a little shooting trip tomorrow, just to break the monotony
of your existence here, and perhaps give you a chance to carry home a
memento of life down in Arizona, that every time you scrape your feet upon
it, will call up a few of the things that have happened here.”</p>

<p>“Please go on, and tell us more about it, Uncle; do we get a chance to
snap off a picture of a bunch of antelopes this time; that
wolf scene is going to turn out a jim-dandy, I reckon; and I’m anxious to
try another,” Andy went on to say.</p>

<p>“Well, you boys have sure locoed the whole community with that wonder
of an aeroplane, and perhaps, if the ranchers hope to get any decent work
out of their punchers, we’d better give them a little rest along that
line. But we’ve been troubled of late with losing some of our best
heifers; and the boys declare they’ve found tracks of a grizzly that comes
down out of the hills and gets his supper every once in so often. So
Buckskin is going along to show us where he thinks the old fellow lives;
and perhaps you can get a snapshot of him before we start in to puncture
his tough old hide with our lead. How about that, boys; think you’d like
to see how we rid the country of a pest that plays havoc with our
herds?”</p>

<p>Frank smiled and nodded as if pleased, but Andy as usual broke out into
a series of exclamations that told how delighted he would be at the
chance.</p>

<p>“Then it’s a go,” remarked Mr. Witherspoon, carelessly, as though such
things as bagging a ferocious grizzly bear were, after all
 of every day occurrence in the life of a cattle raiser; and
to be looked up, as Andy, for instance might consider an ordinary flight
over the level plain, “I’ll see to it that you both have guns, and we’ll
start shortly after breakfast, so as to do most of our riding before it
gets too hot. Then, if we want, after we’ve bagged our game we might hang
round in the foothills and try to keep cool until near sunset, when we’ll
start back,” and he went on talking of other things as though this were
but a small matter.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='Out for Bear' id='chXI'>
CHAPTER XI—OUT FOR BEAR
</h2>

<p>“What do you think of this for a place to rout out a bear, eh, boys?”
and as Mr. Witherspoon asked this question he drew in his sweating pony,
and jumped to the ground.</p>

<p>The Bird Boys glanced around them. It was a wild prospect that greeted
their gaze. They had left the level plains and entered among the rocky
foothills that stretched out from the spur of the great Rockies reaching
far down into Arizona.</p>

<p>In all probability this State has a greater range of extremes in the
way of geographic features than any other in the Union. It possesses arid
deserts, fertile plains; and the whole upper part is a mass of rugged
mountain ranges, some of them as yet really never fully explored, and in
which many valuable minerals have been found that yield fortunes to the
capitalists whose money has made the mines possible.</p>

<p>These contrasts are often sharply defined, the desert touching the very
border of a fertile tract, or running to the edge of the uplifts where,
among the rocks, some rippling little stream dashes down, to
mysteriously disappear under the burning sands as though swallowed up.</p>

<p>After a rather long and exhausting gallop that covered many miles the
little hunting party of four had now arrived among the rocky spurs, and
entered what was to all appearances a pass, though Buckskin called it a
coulie, which might stand for a deep ravine, or a gulch, differing from
the dry bed of a former stream which is known as a barranca.</p>

<p>“Do we leave the ponies here, Uncle?” asked Frank, who had come to call
Mr. Witherspoon thus familiarly, though of course the gentleman was no
relation, being connected on the side of Andy’s mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, staking them out where they can get a bite to eat from that grass
yonder, while we’re gone. We gave them all the water they could drink a
short time back; and that’ll have to do until we start home. Going to snap
us off again while we stand here beside our mounts, are you, Andy?” and
the rancher, who by this, had found himself taken in a dozen different
attitudes, and was getting used to it, laughed good-naturedly as he struck
a natural pose, with one hand stroking the neck of his cayuse.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s all over with,” replied Andy, coolly, “I saw my chance, and
just pressed the bulb when nobody was looking. And I bet you
I got a good one, too. That’s always the best way to do. When people think
they’re getting in a picture they make all sorts of queer faces trying to
look nice, and it spoils things. But the next one I hope will be of Mr.
Grizzly, and say, Uncle, we won’t have to tell him to look pleasant, will
we?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve no doubt but that when he knows what you’re after he’ll just
rear up on his hind legs, and grin like a booby,” chuckled Frank. “I guess
these grizzlies don’t often get a chance to have their pictures taken, and
he’ll be obliged to you for the opening. I hope you get a good one, that’s
all, Andy.”</p>

<p>They threw themselves down to rest.</p>

<p>“No hurry about getting to work,” said Mr. Witherspoon, as he lighted
his pipe, from which he seemed capable of sucking considerable enjoyment.
“We might as well take it easy for a little, while Buckskin is skirmishing
around, to see if he can locate signs of our four-footed friend up yonder
among the rocks. An hour at this time of day won’t matter much anyhow,
because chances are the old rascal is sleeping off the effects of the big
dinner he made last night off another of my heifers, so the foreman
reported.” The boys were not unwilling, because the ride
had been hot and dusty; and just there the air seemed stirring a little,
which made the shade very agreeable, after the open glare of the bright
sun.</p>

<p>“But suppose the bear should happen along here after we’ve gone, and
take a notion to tackle one of your ponies, Uncle, wouldn’t that be a
pretty tough joke on us, if we had to go back double?” remarked Andy, as
he pottered with his camera, to make sure that it was in the very best of
condition for the work he expected to put it to presently, if they were
lucky enough to come across Bruin.</p>

<p>“Well, you are the greatest hand to think up trouble I ever saw, my
lad,” declared the free and easy-going rancher, “that never occurred to me
at all, and I don’t believe there’s one chance in ten of it coming to
pass, because all respectable bears should be asleep in their dens at this
hot time of day. I reckon then we’ll have to risk it, unless one of you
boys choose to sit here and stand guard.”</p>

<p>Of course this was said in the light of a joke, because he knew full
well neither of them could be induced to lose this glorious chance to see
a real grizzly of the Rockies at home.</p>

<p>Frank wanted to do a little of the shooting, if possible;
and as for Andy, he had become so thoroughly infatuated with the business
of picture taking that if he were compelled to choose between snapping off
the bear’s likeness, or putting a chunk of lead between his ribs, Frank
believed he would take the former, and lose all opportunity for securing
the trophy of the chase for a rug.</p>

<p>They were still lounging there some time later when a rattling of small
stones announced that somebody or some thing was approaching from up the
side of the coulie. Mr. Witherspoon just allowed his hand to creep out to
where his repeating Marlin lay. Not that he suspected any danger might be
hanging over their heads; but then one wants to be on the foothills of the
Rockies, where grizzlies have their dens and sometimes cattle rustlers
hide out waiting for a chance to descend on the unprotected herds, which
may be driven away to a secret cache, where their marks can be altered,
and then the animals sold, or shipped on the railroad to a distant
point.</p>

<p>But it turned out to be Buckskin, and with a wide grin decorating his
bronzed face, which Frank rightly interpreted to signify that he had found
the den he was so positive must be near by. “Hit her the
first thing, boys,” he chirped cheerfully, as he threw himself down
alongside the others, to cool off a little. “And believe me, things look
good for findin’ our chap at home. He dragged that heifer all the way up
here, consarn his old hide. I could see marks of blood on his doorsill.
Reckons as how we ketched him next door to in the act, Mr. Witherspoon;
got him with the goods on, we have. And here’s hopin’ that’ll be the last
young beef he’ll steal from the Double X Ranch.”</p>

<p>After a short time the rancher got up, and threw his rifle in the
hollow of his arm. While lying there he had told the boys about all that
he could remember concerning the habits and peculiarities of grizzlies,
and also warned them not to be sparing of their lead when once they
commenced to throw it; because there is not another living wild beast,
hunters declare, that can stand up under and carry off more bullets than
one of these monsters.</p>

<p>The four of them commenced to climb the rocky slope. It was no easy
task, but they took their time about it, Mr. Witherspoon pointing out how
Buckskin had undoubtedly followed the occasional traces left by the bear
in his many pilgrimages along the same route—scratches from his terribly
long claws; or it might be occasional tiny stains of blood
from the carcass of the heifer he had dragged all the way from the grass
country, and along these ragged rocks, just as though it was the easiest
proposition that had ever been put up to him.</p>

<p>“Thar she is!” said Buckskin, suddenly, pointing with his rifle.</p>

<p>Following the direction of his outstretched weapon, the boys saw what
seemed to be a seam in the face of the rocky wall a little distance away.
As they advanced still further they realized that it widened near the
base, and afforded quite an opening, through which even the bulky figure
of a grizzly could pass with ease.</p>

<p>And upon looking, they found innumerable evidences of the fact that
some animal had long been in the habit of passing in and out of this
fissure.</p>

<p>“Why, here’s a bunch of brown hairs sticking to this sharp point of
rock, rubbed off when he scraped past!” declared the keen-eyed Frank
immediately after taking a look around.</p>

<p>“Good for you, my boy!” exclaimed the rancher, evidently well pleased
at this evidence of alertness on the part of his charge. “Yes, that came
from the hide of a Mountain Charlie, as they call them out in California.
You can see how coarse it is. Keep it as a memento; but I
certain sure hope you’ll get the real thing before we gallop back for our
supper late tonight.”</p>

<p>“How about him rushing out and surprising us, Uncle?” asked Andy.
“Perhaps the old fellow mightn’t like to have company dropping in on him
without an invite. And then, you see, I wouldn’t have any focus at all,
which would spoil my picture.”</p>

<p>“No need of worrying about that, my lad,” said the rancher. “He’s lying
in there as snug as you please, with his stomach full of that juicy
heifer; and it’ll be a hard proposition for us to coax him to consent to
an interview at all. Chances are, Buckskin’ll have to smoke the old
villain out. That sometimes happens. But we might as well begin to make
all our arrangements, looking to getting that picture at the right focus;
and also placing that little defile between us and the bear when he does
come out, mad as hops at being treated to a smoke.”</p>

<p>He had apparently already figured it all out in his own mind and made
the necessary arrangements; for he led them across a deep little defile
that happened to lie between the bear’s den and a flat stretch of rock,
just fifty paces away.</p>

<p>From this spot a splendid view could be had of the
yawning crevice at the base of the cliff. And Andy was delighted to see
that for the next hour the sun would be favorable to his work of securing
a good exposure, given the subject.</p>

<p>“Got your focus all right, have you?” asked the rancher, when he heard
Andy give a grunt as of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Andy went on to say, smilingly, “everything stands out as clear
as a bell; and I think I ought to make a boss picture of this; that is, if
I don’t go and foozle, because of stage fright, when the old rascal comes
roaring out to ask what we want. You won’t shoot in too big a hurry, I
hope; give me time to snap off a couple, for fear one might be spoiled.
These sort of chances come only once in a life time you know; and ought to
be doubled up, to make sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re all ready here, perhaps you’d better get busy,
Buckskin, and see if you can bring him out with a few cowboy yells. If
that fails, then there’s some wood over yonder you can use; and I notice
that you grabbed up some stink-weed as you came along, which will fetch
him dead sure, when it gets to smouldering. Sometimes I even think it
would bring a dead man to life, it’s that powerful. We’ll leave this
little log across the gully, just as we used it to cross on;
when you jump over for keeps give the same a kick; and that’ll put a gap
between, the old man can’t cross in a hurry, if so be he fails to drop
under our fire.”</p>

<p>Accordingly Buckskin trailing his gun along after him, crossed on the
aforesaid log that served as a bridge over the gully, and went about his
business of trying to coax the occupant of the rocky bear’s den to come
out, with just as much indifference as though he were obeying the call of
the range to dinner, when the cook pounded on a big frying pan with a
basting spoon.</p>

<p>And standing there, the boys and Mr. Witherspoon awaited developments
with varied emotions.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='The Defense of the Log Bridge' id='chXII'>
CHAPTER XII—THE DEFENSE OF THE LOG BRIDGE
</h2>

<p>“Listen to Buckskin calling him all sorts of names, would you?”
exclaimed Andy, a few minutes later.</p>

<p>“If that bear only understood half he’s been called, he just couldn’t
stand it a minute longer,” declared Mr. Witherspoon, chuckling, “but the
poor old chap’s education has been neglected, so he doesn’t know cowboy
lingo. I reckon he never even opens one eye, but keeps dozing right along.
He hasn’t lost any cowboy, and so he doesn’t want to be bothered. No good,
is it, Buckskin?”</p>

<p>“Don’t look that way, sir,” replied the other, disconsolately, “that’s
the trouble with not having the gift of gab. Now, if I was as good a hand
at callin’ names, and rattling off the lingo as Puffer Pete, chances are
he’d just have to show a leg. Well, here’s to open up a little smoke spell
with the boss.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, he bent over, and seemed to be fixing the small tinder he
had carried across with him. Now and then he would turn his head and call
out something or other to the boys, as though explaining to
the boys what he was doing.</p>

<p>“Now she’s all ready for biz,” he finally declared, “watch my smoke,
fellers. Hi! here’s looking to you, old man; you’ve just got to wake up,
and let us take a look at your mug, you know. There she goes!
Whoop-la!”</p>

<p>The watchers saw a wisp of smoke creep up lazily. There did not seem to
be any wind to carry it away; and presently it met a back draught, for it
appeared to be sucked directly into the yawning crevice at the base of the
cliff.</p>

<p>Larger grew the volume of smoke, until quite a good-sized column was
oozing out of the brush Buckskin had piled up.</p>

<p>“Now for the scent weed!” he called out.</p>

<p>They saw him carefully place some of this on top of the pile, and
toward the back where its odor would be sure to be wafted into the den,
with the smoke from the burning wood.</p>

<p>“Wow! that’s fierce!” Buckskin whooped, grabbing hold of his nose with
the fingers of his free hand, for he was holding fast to his gun all this
time, not knowing when he might have to use it.</p>

<p>Now he was bending down as though listening to catch the first low
growl to indicate that Bruin had awakened, and was sniffing at the smoke.
 Buckskin’s attitude told how he was holding himself in
readiness for a lively sprint, just as soon as the signs warned him that
the bear was rushing for the exit of the den in a terrible rage at being
interrupted in his nap. No sensible cowboy ever wants to come to close
grips with an enraged grizzly; he knows too much to risk a terrible death
in that way.</p>

<p>It was a period of most intense suspense to both the boys.</p>

<p>All at once they saw the crouching cowboy galvanized into life. He
leaped to his feet, and made a lively streak for the little log crossing
the gap. No need to ask what induced his haste, for actions spoke louder
than words in that case.</p>

<p>“Ready, Andy!” Mr. Witherspoon was heard to say, hoarsely.</p>

<p>This thing of attacking a full-grown grizzly in his native haunts was
no child’s play; and even so old a hunter as the owner of Double X Ranch
doubtless felt more than a little thrill as he watched to see the head of
the monster thrust out of the hole in the wall.</p>

<p>Andy had his kodak on a line with that opening and was crouching there
ready to get in some good work. Let Frank have the glory of shooting the
bear if he wanted; as for him, he found more solid
satisfaction nowadays in getting snapshots of game, than in trying to lay
them low.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>It was Andy who gave utterance to this cry. A great dun-colored bulk
had rushed directly across the heap of smoking fire-stuff, scattering it
to the right, and to the left, as he gave a fearful roar that made the
echoes ring.</p>

<p>And right then and there Andy pressed the bulb. He believed he had
caught the bear just in the act of throwing the fire every-which-way, as
Andy himself expressed it later on.</p>

<p>Immediately he started to turn the film so as to bring around a new and
unexposed section. His fingers were quivering with eagerness and
nervousness, so that he could hardly hold the camera.</p>

<p>“Steady, Andy; brace up, and take your time!” said Frank, who gave his
chum one quick glance to see how near he was to getting in a second
snapshot before he and Mr. Witherspoon started to firing.</p>

<p>That seemed to bring Andy to his senses, and the next moment he managed
to get his second shot at the bear.</p>

<p>By this time the animal had discovered the running Buckskin, and
immediately started in hot pursuit, as if recognizing the
human agency that had made his eyes smart so with that pungent smoke;
there was now no longer any trouble about arousing the bear’s fury; and
Frank realized just why Buckskin, wise fellow that he was, had lost not a
second about getting started, when he knew the bear was coming.</p>

<p>He cast one glance over his shoulder as he reached the end of the
little log. Discovering the grizzly shuffling along swiftly in his wake,
snorting with anger, the cowboy immediately started across the rude
bridge. Once he slipped, and for a second or two it looked as though he
would drop down twenty feet or more into the gully; but by a desperate
effort Buckskin managed to climb up again, and mostly on hands and knees
completed the passage.</p>

<p>The bear was still coming on, apparently in no wise daunted by the hot
fire that was being poured into him by Frank and Mr. Witherspoon. Every
shot Frank took he fully expected to see the huge beast go tumbling over;
but in spite of all, the bear kept rushing after Buckskin. Andy was still
working his kodak and taking more pictures.</p>

<p>Just as soon as the cowboy managed to crawl upon solid rock he started
to dislodge the log. It proved a little more difficult than had been
 expected. Three times did Buckskin make the effort, and only
succeeded in moving the end a few inches on every occasion.</p>

<p>With the bear still coming on, as though capable of standing a
hurricane of lead, it began to look serious enough. Should he ever succeed
in crossing that log what might not happen to the hunters? Frank felt a
cold chill creep over him as he contemplated such a possibility, and
realized that the magazine in his Marlin heavy-bore was getting low.</p>

<p>Well, Andy came to the rescue just in time. Dropping his kodak, he
sprang to the side of the panting Buckskin.</p>

<p>“Now, together!” he exclaimed, as he took hold of the end of the
log.</p>

<p>It slipped from its anchorage just as the grizzly reached the opposite
bank. Had they been three seconds later they must have hurled the shaggy
monster down with the queer log bridge.</p>

<p>Bruin stopped in his mad advance just in time. He sniffed at the spot
where the end of the log had rested, as though wondering how the human
enemy could have apparently flown across.</p>

<p>This gave the marksmen a better chance to place their bullets where
they were more apt to count. Frank took deliberate aim back
of the foreleg. At the same time he was conscious of a feeling of great
respect for this brave old fellow, whom nothing could apparently daunt.
But they had put their hand to the plow, and there could be no turning
back at this late hour. Besides, this beast was bound to be a constant
menace to ranchman’s herds from this time on, now that he had learned the
secret of securing an easy breakfast from the weaker elements of the
cattle drove; and it was of the greatest importance that he be
exterminated.</p>

<p>This time when Frank pulled the trigger of his Marlin he saw that he
had at last reached a vital organ. The big bear actually weakened and fell
over, though still struggling hard to keep on his feet and show a grim
front.</p>

<p>“That did for him, Frank; no use to waste any more ammunition!”
declared Mr. Witherspoon.</p>

<p>“Well, that was my last shot, anyway, so I couldn’t do anything more
until I’d recharged the magazine of my gun,” remarked Frank.</p>

<p>“And unless I’m mistaken, my weapon is in just the same fix,” chuckled
the other, “so you can understand what a lot of lead a grizzly can digest
before knuckling under.”</p>

<p>“There, the old critter has keeled over, and that’s his
last kick,” remarked Buckskin, who was still panting from his recent
exertions. “Say, Andy, d’ye want me to snap one off with you and Frank
standing by the game? Seems to me you had ought to be seen in some of
these here pictures. Reckon I know enough to aim, after you do the focus
act, and squeeze that rubber thing.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to cross over first, and our bully old bridge is down at
the bottom of the hole,” expostulated Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh! here’s another log that will answer just as well,” remarked the
ranger, “just looks like these trees once grew here to accommodate anyone
who wanted to use a log for a bridge. Everybody take hold, and we’ll soon
have it across.”</p>

<p>After some trying they managed to get the log on end near the edge of
the gap. It was no trouble, then, to let it fall directly across, and as
they had calculated rightly, there was another means of spanning the
gulf.</p>

<p>So, one after another, they walked across; in fact Andy and Buckskin
were so anxious to see what the grizzly looked like, that they neglected
to go back and pick up their guns, which they had carelessly dropped at
the time their help was needed in order to move the log. 
Andy insisted that Uncle Jethro also line up alongside the dead
grizzly.</p>

<p>“You helped knock him out, and ought to be here more than me,” he
declared, when the rancher showed signs of holding back; and so finally
the three were grouped in a manner to allow of the game being shown, while
the hunters also appeared in the picture.</p>

<p>After Andy had arranged this to suit him, he gave the camera into the
charge of Buckskin, and then went over to take his place alongside Frank
and the ranchman.</p>

<p>“Now, look in the finder, and see that you’ve got the bear in the
middle of the picture,” Andy sang out. “How about it, Buckskin?”</p>

<p>“She’s all right, Andy; tell me when to give the punch,” came the
reply.</p>

<p>“Be sure and hold the camera steady as a rock when you’re going to
squeeze the bulb. Now, let her go, Gallagher!” and Andy assumed a pose as
he spoke.</p>

<p>Immediately after there was a whoop.</p>

<p>“Right there with the goods, and a regular bull’s-eye at that!” shouted
Buckskin. “I’m the boss boy with the picture machine, let me tell you. You
see if that ain’t a family group to do you proud! Want any more took,
Andy? Just you warble the word and Buckskin, he’ll try to
accommerdate you all that’s a-goin’; sure he will. How about standin’ the
bar up on his hind legs and take him that way! Wow! holy smoke! look
what’s comin’ in on us, would you? Another bar, and bigger nor this un at
that? Must be the mate o’ our game, and lookin’ kinder mad at us. Whar’s
my gun? What in creation did I do with that six-shot pepper box? Run boys,
he’s chargin’ us!”</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='Never-to-be-Forgotten Days' id='chXIII'>
CHAPTER XIII—NEVER-TO-BE-FORGOTTEN DAYS
</h2>

<p>Things started in happening about that time.</p>

<p>And conditions could hardly have been much worse; for while Frank and
Mr. Witherspoon had their rifles along, the magazines had been exhausted
in their recent shooting affair; while the only two serviceable guns lay
on the other side of the little gulf that was spanned by the log.</p>

<p>“Get to the bridge as fast as you can!” called out the ranchman, with a
ring of authority in his voice.</p>

<p>It might have been noticed that Andy did not wait this time to complain
about the “focus,” and all that sort of thing; in fact, he simply ran for
the avenue of escape without once looking around him. And both Frank and
Mr. Witherspoon kept him pretty close company.</p>

<p>Buckskin had been close to the bridge himself at the time of his making
that astonishing discovery; and hence he was already passing over. As a
cowboy is not so sure-footed as a good many people accustomed to walking,
there were times when it began to look as though he might lose
 his grip again, and be compelled to resort to the original
method of using his hands and knees.</p>

<p>“Don’t let my kodak drop, Buckskin!” shrieked Andy, really more
concerned about the safety of his little camera just then than his own
safety.</p>

<p>Perhaps his outcry did have some steadying effect upon the other, for
he managed to get to the opposite side without having to descend to any
humiliating experience, but it was a close shave.</p>

<p>And now the boys understood just why Buckskin had made such mad haste.
It was not because he meant to forsake them, or was so tremendously
alarmed regarding his own condition. He had suddenly remembered that the
guns that were charged had been left across on the other side, and
somebody must charge that bridge in order to lay hands on them.</p>

<p>It was doubtless very fortunate for all concerned that the second
grizzly did not see fit to charge as ferociously as had its dead mate; for
in such a case the chances were they must have been mixed up with those
long, cruel claws before the lot of them could cross over.</p>

<p>The newcomer stopped to sniff at the body of the other animal too, and
this delayed things for a few seconds; just enough for them to get
 safely over, and for history to repeat itself in so far as
hurling the log into the hole was concerned.</p>

<p>Already Buckskin was getting busy with his repeater; and Andy, not to
be left in the lurch, also scrambled over to where his gun lay.</p>

<p>Once more the battle was resumed, with all the odds on the side of
those who, safe from the claws of the monster could at the same time send
their little leaden messengers of death across the gulf, and into the body
of the grizzly.</p>

<p>It hardly seemed fair, and yet what else can be done when dealing with
such a terrible beast? Three men, yes, half a dozen, would not be too many
to meet so ferocious a fighter at close quarters; and in order to win out,
it is necessary to take advantage of every opening.</p>

<p>Rendered furious because of his wounds, and his inability to get at the
objects of his hatred, the bear finally rushed straight at them, and of
course toppled over the edge into the gap.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Witherspoon and Frank were getting fresh cartridges into
the magazines of their guns as fast as their trembling hands could
accomplish the feat. No one could tell how many shots might be found
necessary before the tenacious life of the monster was snuffed out.
 “He’s dropped in!” shouted Andy, who had managed to
discharge his gun twice, and seemed to feel that he had had something more
or less to do with this last queer action on the part of the charging
bear.</p>

<p>“Look out for him climbing up the side!” cried the rancher, doing his
level best to get his weapon in serviceable condition.</p>

<p>“No danger, boss!” whooped Buckskin, who, down on hands and knees
beside the edge of the gully, was trying to figure out what the condition
of the bear might be, “he’s gone and cashed his checks in this time, and
we done it all by ourselves, sure we did, Andy. Say, wasn’t he a whopper,
now? And let’s get ready in case there happens to be a whole menagerie of
the varmints around these diggings.”</p>

<p>After their guns had been placed in serviceable condition they crept to
the edge of the little gulch and surveyed the huddled-up mass of hair,
each declaring it to be his positive belief that the bear must be
dead.</p>

<p>“Let’s some of us go down to him!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“You bet we will,” echoed Andy; “I want that bearskin the worst kind,
because, unless I’m greatly off my guess, there are just three holes in
the same that my bullets made. How can we do it, Uncle
Jethro. Please put us wise.”</p>

<p>The rancher knew easily enough how it could be done. He even
volunteered to be the one who should drop down and secure the pelt of the
dead bear. It was finally arranged, however, that Buckskin should do this
business while Mr. Witherspoon performed the same kind of operation in
connection with the first victim.</p>

<p>“Just to think of bagging two bears on the same afternoon!” exclaimed
the proud Andy, as he danced around, trying the best he knew how to get
some sort of picture of his own prize, for the cowboy loudly declared that
it must have been a bullet from Andy’s gun that did the business.</p>

<p>“It’s so dark and gloomy down there, you see,” he complained, as
Buckskin hunted for a way to clamber down. “If only I had thought to fetch
along one of my flash-light cartridges now, I could do it; or have him
take me standing with my foot on the prize, and my trusty gun in my hands.
But that’s all off.”</p>

<p>“What’s to hinder me taking you in that position with the other bear?”
ventured Frank; “we could slew it around a little, so that it wouldn’t
look the same as in the first picture; and having two skins would prove
that we got that many bears.” So Andy finally consented to
pose, and accordingly had his picture taken in the conventional attitude
of saying: “Look what a big hunter I am?”</p>

<p>It required considerable time to remove the two hides; but then cowboys
know how to go about it, and Mr. Witherspoon was also handy with the
hunting knife; so that in the end it was accomplished.</p>

<p>As the afternoon was still pretty warm, they decided to rest again. At
the request of Andy the puncher got several pieces of wood that might be
made to serve in lieu of torches; and with these they explored the
interior of the bear’s den. There was quite a heap of bones inside the
hole, and once more Andy deplored his want of forethought in not providing
himself with a number of those convenient flash-light affairs, by means of
which interiors may be photographed so well.</p>

<p>“You don’t find me ever going anywhere with my old kodak, without
thinking about having a light along,” he complained. “Just when you think
you won’t need such a thing, the greatest chance you ever saw happens
along and makes you feel sick. Why, I don’t know what I wouldn’t give to
have a chance to take a picture of a real bear’s den like that.”
 Buckskin thereupon consoled him with the promise to ride
over another day, amply provided with all the necessaries, if it so be Mr.
Witherspoon allowed to let him off, which the generous ranchman readily
agreed to do, because he would have consented to almost anything if it
would add to the pleasure of this nephew in whom he was taking such
unusual interest.</p>

<p>When the sun had dropped low enough so that its heat was not
depressing, they started back home, taking things easily by the way.</p>

<p>Their mounts had been rested, and besides, knew which way they were now
heading, and could be depended on to keep doggedly at work, without any
“sojering,” or trying to “play lame,” as some smart cow ponies have been
known to do when not in the humor for work.</p>

<p>The moon gave them light when night came on, and by ten o’clock they
reached the ranch buildings. Expecting them at about this time, Charley
Woo had a splendid supper all ready, to which the tired boys did ample
justice.</p>

<p>But the story of the hunt was reserved for the morrow; because Mr.
Witherspoon saw that the others were ready to drop after all those hours
in the saddle, added to the nervous excitement of that thrilling bear
hunt. It was now drawing close to the time when the regular
fall round-up was scheduled to come off; for Mr. Witherspoon was one of
those careful ranchmen who did not let things get too far ahead of him;
and he wanted to know what his herds had been doing for him during the
summer season, so that all youngsters might be given the brand that would
stamp them as his property.</p>

<p>Although both Frank and Andy had witnessed the operation on smaller
scales several times, so that the novelty had in a measure worn off, still
they laid out to accompany the band when they went forth in full strength
to cover the range, and be away several days and nights at least.</p>

<p>Andy, of course, wanted to secure a few more striking pictures that
would illustrate the stories they wished to tell upon reaching home again.
The only thing he deplored was the fact that his stock of films was
running very low; he had been too lavish in the beginning, not leaving
enough for the more important subjects apt to crowd up later.</p>

<p>But he had developed the roll containing the bear scenes, and was as he
admitted “tickled nearly to death” with the splendid results. Why, it
looked just as if that fierce old denizen of the cleft in the rock was
roaring out his anger and defiance as he threw the fire
sticks in every direction; and as for the other one, with Buckskin
crawling along the log bridge, and the grizzly galloping down toward the
end of the same, the cowboy declared that he could almost hear himself
saying bad words because of his dizzy head, that always played him false
in an emergency like this.</p>

<p>Why, a whole month had slipped away since their arrival at the ranch;
and in a few more weeks they would have to be thinking of getting ready to
travel back to Bloomsbury and school! Every time they talked of it the
boys felt blue; not that Frank and Andy did not want to see the dear ones
at home; but they were certainly having the time of their lives down here
in Arizona, and hated to leave until they had utterly exhausted the mine
of pleasures that awaited their attention on every hand.</p>

<p>Uncle Jethro was kindness itself. He never wearied of thinking up all
sorts of things that he believed the two Bird boys would enjoy; and when
he could not accompany them in person, he sent Buckskin instead; so that
they came to have a decided fancy for the odd little “sawed off” of a
cowboy, as he himself described his lack of stature.</p>

<p>And so it came about that one night the ranchman remarked
that all preparations had been made to start on the following day on the
round-up; the various herds would be ready for their inspection; and
before they came back doubtless every part of the wide-spreading territory
contained in Double X Ranch would have been raked over as with a
fine-tooth comb, looking for mavericks and stray bunches.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='Off For the Round-Up' id='chXIV'>
CHAPTER XIV—OFF FOR THE ROUND-UP
</h2>

<p>“Phew! it looks like another hot day, Frank!”</p>

<p>Andy had just dressed, and gone to the window to look out. The sun was
already up, and had that queer, dark red glow that betokens an unusual
display of heat. It would be a hard day for the long ride across the
treeless level stretching out between the ranch buildings and the grassy
valleys where the cattle generally bunched at this time of year.</p>

<p>Frank had been strangely silent while dressing; and as he now joined
his cousin at the window, Andy noticed for the first time that he was
looking rather “peaked.”</p>

<p>“Here, what’s the matter with you, old fellow?” he asked, with his
customary breezy impulsiveness. “You don’t seem a bit tickled over the
idea of spending a whole day in the saddle, and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the other, with a little smile, “the fact is, Andy, I’m
afraid I’m going to disappoint you.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” demanded his cousin, aggressively. “I
don’t think I’d better try going today, and that’s a fact,” Frank went
on.</p>

<p>“Are you sick? Is that what ails you? Seemed to me you kicked around a
whole lot last night, now I come to think of it. Why, didn’t you call me
up, Frank? What’s the matter? I just bet the heat was too much for you
yesterday. We shouldn’t have done that long ride on so nasty a day; felt
like I was drawn through a straw myself, though I’m all right now. But do
you really mean that you won’t ride out today with the boys?”</p>

<p>“The way I feel now, it would be silly for me to try it,” Frank
continued, with a little shake of his head. “I seem to be dizzy, and to
sit on the back of a lively pony for even an hour would upset me like
everything.”</p>

<p>“That’s a shame now, ain’t it, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t mind it so very much. You’ll only be gone a couple or
three days at the most; and I’ll have Mrs. Ogden, Charley Woo, and little
Becky to keep me company. And then, if I’m feeling myself by tomorrow, why
I might take a notion to look you boys up by the air route. Don’t worry
about me, Andy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to, because I expect to stay with you and see that you
get the right kind of care,” said Andy, with his positive
face in evidence.</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” retorted Frank. “I’ll be in good
hands, and the chances are will be all right by noon. So you’re just going
along with Uncle and the rest.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see anybody make me when I put my foot down,” Andy went on
to say. “The fact of the matter is, Frank, between you and me and the
lamp-post, when I found out what sort of a scorcher we were in for today,
I began to lose some of my own enthusiasm. Sure I’d have gone along if you
were all right, and taken my medicine as well as I could; but this alkali
dust don’t please me a whit; and on a red hot day it’s a lot of a nuisance
to have to keep on riding in a saddle on such a slow thing as a
cayuse.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re spoiled by this mile-a-minute gait of your air steed,
that’s plain,” chuckled Frank, “but your uncle will be disappointed if you
don’t go along, Andy.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have to be, then,” returned the other steadily, as though his
mind was made up, and nothing could change it. “I don’t pretend to be able
to keep up with Buckskin, Shorty and all that lot of hard riders. They can
wear me to a frazzle in the long run. My place, where I
shine, is with you in a biplane. There you don’t have to work your way,
but just sit and enjoy the grandest view any fellow ever had spread out
before him, while’s he spinning along at much more than a mile-a-minute
speed. The air route for mine, every time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I see there’s no use trying to force you to go; but I’m sorry
that this has happened, Andy.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! don’t you bother your head about me,” his cousin said, with a
chuckle. “Fact is, I’m rather tickled at finding an excuse for backing
down without its looking that I’m showing the white feather. That thought
of three days in the saddle, with the heat and dust gave me a bad feeling.
And Frank, perhaps we might look the boys and their chuck wagon up
tomorrow in our biplane. That’s a heap sight more to my fancy, let me tell
you, now.”</p>

<p>“All right, Andy. But there’s your uncle outside, looking after things.
We’d better see him, and let him know, before he gets ponies ready for
us.”</p>

<p>Both boys went outside, and when Mr. Witherspoon heard about Frank’s
sickness he expressed the greatest concern. After hearing the symptoms he
agreed with Andy that it must have been the extreme heat of the
 preceding day that had knocked his cousin out.</p>

<p>“Nothing serious at all,” announced the ranchman, “I’ve felt the same
way myself more than a few times, after unusual heat, and hard riding. No
use trying to keep in the saddle when you’ve got that dizzy spell; just
lie down, and Mrs. Ogden ’ll give you a dose of the same medicine that
always brings me around. Chances are you’ll be feeling all right by noon,
or before night, anyway.”</p>

<p>“We feel sorry not to be able to go along with you on the round-up,
Uncle,” remarked Andy.</p>

<p>“I’d put off starting until tomorrow, boys, only all preparations have
been made and it would interfere with our work more or less,” the ranchman
went on to say with a tinge of regret in his voice, as though he were
tempted to do this at any cost.</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t think of letting you do such a thing, sir!” exclaimed
Frank.</p>

<p>“And besides,” added his cousin, “if Frank is all right tomorrow, you
may see us sailing along to hunt you up, and with a map of the whole ranch
spread out before us.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’ll take a spin in your biplane, is that it, boys?” Mr.
Witherspoon went on, “Good! Nothing would please us better.
 I can imagine the antics of the cattle when they see a great
bird settling down over them.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we’ll be careful, and try and not start a stampede, Uncle; if we
do come, after we’ve located where you’re working at the time, we’ll drop
down some distance away, and walk over; or you can send mounts for us. But
I don’t care to go without Frank, you see. And to tell the honest truth,
I’m a bit leery about riding through such a scorching hot day as this
promises to be.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re wise, my boy,” said the ranchman, reflectively, “it’s
hard enough on us old shellbacks, used to breathing this alkali dust from
one end of the year to the other, and must be rough on tenderfeet. Make
yourselves at home; the best is none too good for you. Charley Woo thinks
you are a couple of little tin gods on wheels, and he’ll do anything in
the wide world for the wizards who can mount up to the clouds, and play
tag there with the winds.”</p>

<p>Frank, though looking badly, would not go in and lie down while the
outfit was getting in readiness to start. He wanted to see all that went
on, for the chance might never come to him again.</p>

<p>And Andy was busy snapping off several pictures of the
scene, as the bunch of active cow punchers galloped around on their
ponies, making the animals do all sorts of wonderful feats as they
curvetted and pranced, and snorted with the excitement.</p>

<p>“I’ve just got another film of a dozen exposures,” he complained to
Frank, after he had taken several views of the chuck wagon, and the string
of led ponies that had to be taken along for service when the hard riding
boys wore out their first mounts, “and with that I want to get my pictures
of the round-up; also one of the dinner hour, when the entire crowd
gathers around the chuck wagon.”</p>

<p>“But how is it that Charley Woo doesn’t go along this time; I thought
he always did the cooking for the crowd when they went off like this?”
Frank remarked.</p>

<p>“I asked Uncle about that, and he said that the boys had been
complaining somewhat lately about the Chinaman’s way of cooking. He
thought they were just spoiled by having things too good; and to show them
the difference he has arranged to let Shorty do the cooking on this trip.
He used to, long ago, before Charley came along, and got the job.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s it; and the boys are in for a lesson, I can see. When they
get a dose of the old style of slinging hash together
they’ll never have another word to say about Charley. That’s the way
things go, sometimes; you never miss the water until the well runs
dry.”</p>

<p>“Looks like they might be going to start right away, Frank. Here come
the boys on the jump, to say goodbye, and hope you’ll be feeling better
soon.”</p>

<p>“I hope they won’t think I’m faking this headache, just to get out of
riding on the round-up with them?” remarked Frank, uneasily.</p>

<p>“They know you better than that,” returned his cousin. “Any fellow who
has got the nerve to ride in an aeroplane would be equal to anything, so
Buckskin and every one else swears. Try as we can, you know there isn’t
one of them dares go up. What Buckskin told them about his sensations has
given the whole bunch cold feet so far as wanting to try a ride among the
clouds. The earth, alkali dust and all, is good enough for them, they say.
Hello! boys, hope you have a grand good time. And if Frank’s feeling O.&#160;K.,
look for us along some time tomorrow. I want to get some cracker-jack
pictures of how you round up the cattle, and brand the same, those that
need the Double X mark.”</p>

<p>Every puncher insisted on gripping the hand of each of
the Bird boys, while his restless pony danced, and snorted, and acted as
though just wild to start off like a comet.</p>

<p>Then came Uncle Jethro and the foreman, Waldo Kline, to also shake
hands, and say how sorry they felt at not having the visitors at the ranch
along; but the boys again repeated their intention of looking in on the
workers later on.</p>

<p>With a tremendous racket and waving of hats, the string started off,
and Andy could not resist aiming his kodak after them, for the scene was
an inspiring one, which he and Frank would never forget.</p>

<p>Further and further away drew the caravan, the mules hitched to the
chuck wagon being kept on the trot by old Shorty, who had once again come
into his own as cook for the outfit; yet wore a troubled look on his face,
as though he felt uneasy concerning the outcome. For cow punchers are no
respecters of persons when they feel that they have good cause for
complaint concerning the quality of the grub with which they are being
served; and Shorty had before then known of cooks being actually tarred
and feathered just because they failed to come up to the expectations of
the clamorous bunch of reckless cow men. When they had
vanished from sight far away over the plain, in a cloud of dust, Frank
went in to lie down again; while Andy started to amuse himself developing
some of the films he had just exposed.</p>

<p>And as the morning advanced it proved even a hotter day than the
preceding one had been, so that Frank felt he had acted wisely in
declining to take chances on so hard a gallop, with his head in such a
whirl.</p>

<p>It was just before noon that Andy came into the room in somewhat of a
state of excitement.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='The One Who Came Back' id='chXV'>
CHAPTER XV—THE ONE WHO CAME BACK
</h2>

<p>“Frank, do you remember what I did with the glasses?” asked Andy,
after he had been looking all around for a minute or two, with a puzzled
expression on his face.</p>

<p>Now, Andy was not quite so methodical as his cousin. He had on occasion
been known to seem a bit careless, to confess the actual truth. And Frank,
knowing how such a habit is apt to grow on anyone unless severely checked,
sometimes played a little trick on his chum with the sole idea of
impressing things upon his mind, and correcting this fault.</p>

<p>He raised his head at Andy’s question.</p>

<p>“Stop and think, where did you have them last?” he remarked,
quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh! say, didn’t I fetch them in last night when we were all looking at
the man in the moon, and those stars that Uncle Jethro said were the Belt
of Orion the Hunter? I’m dead sure I did, Frank; but they don’t seem to be
around here. Do you know where they are? Has anybody borrowed our glasses,
Frank? I want them right now, and I want them bad.”</p>

<p>“Look on the table in the living room, and I think you’ll
find them,” returned Frank, sitting up. “I saw you drop them there last
night, and just wanted to see if you’d remember to fetch them to our room.
But what’s up, Andy?”</p>

<p>“You seem to be, just now, old fellow; which I take it is a good sign
you’re feeling a whole lot better. Glad to know it, and that’s straight.
But about the glasses—why, there’s a lone horseman coming along at a slow
lope, as if he didn’t care to hurry one little bit; and I’m wondering who
it can be.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps some neighboring rancher coming to ask a lot more fool
questions about the cost of biplanes, and whether any puncher who has
broken bronchos all his life could learn to herd cattle with one of these
up-to-date fliers;” and Frank, getting up from the cot, started to
stretch, as though he might indeed be feeling more like himself again, the
dizzy feeling gone.</p>

<p>Andy chuckled at what his cousin said; then, being really curious to
learn the identity of the approaching horseman, he hurried out of the
room.</p>

<p>Frank followed leisurely, and on getting outside found the other with
his eyes glued to the small end of the fine glasses, which had come in so
useful dozens of times when the Bird boys were whirring
through the upper currents, and looking for a place below to land.</p>

<p>“Well, have you made him out?” asked Frank, coming up behind the
other.</p>

<p>Andy took the glasses down as he replied:</p>
    
<p>“That’s as easy as falling off a log, Frank; but I’m wondering what 
under the sun brings Alkali Joe back home again.”</p> 

<p>“Alkali Joe, you say, Andy; why, he went with the bunch this
morning!”</p>

<p>“That’s just what he did,” the other went on to say, a little
excitedly, “but all the same, that’s Joe, as big as life. And if you
notice, Frank, you’ll think it queer that he doesn’t act like they all do
when in the saddle, making his pony go like the wind, and whirling his hat
around his head.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Andy, he doesn’t,” remarked Frank, when he had clapped the
glasses to his eyes; “fact is, Joe acts like he might be going to a
funeral. I never saw a cow puncher come jogging along like that, taking
things as easy as he can.”</p>

<p>“Gee! I hope he isn’t bringing us any bad news!” exclaimed Andy.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” Frank remarked, “I never thought of that; but what sort of
bad news could Uncle Jethro be sending back; and even that
wouldn’t be apt to keep down the bubbling spirits of an average
cowboy.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you think can be the matter?” went on the other.</p>

<p>“I rather believe that Joe has had some sort of attack, just like I
did; and your uncle has sent him home to be dosed and to lie down, knowing
that he’d never be able to keep his seat in the saddle during the wild
dash of the round-up.”</p>

<p>“Frank, I wonder if that could be so?” Andy observed, seriously.
“P’raps it’s going to be an epidemic and the whole of us may be down with
the same, yet. Couldn’t have been locoed by any of that weed they tell us
about, could we? If the cows they use for milkers gobbled any of the same,
would it affect us, do you think?”</p>

<p>That idea tickled Frank, for he laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we stand in any danger that way, Andy,” he went on to
remark, “but anyhow, you’ll know about Joe pretty soon, for he’s coming
along on a steady lope, and will be here inside of ten minutes, at
most.”</p>

<p>They stood and watched the cow puncher swinging along at that easy
gait; it seemed as though the man in the sheepskin chaps might be part and
parcel with his pony they moved with such a steady rhythm.
And before the time limit which Frank had set expired he had come to a
full stop before them.</p>

<p>But Frank had already made a discovery. This was to the effect that one
of Joe’s lower limbs seemed to be bound up with a rough bandage.</p>

<p>“What happened, Joe?” he asked, stepping forward to the side of the
other, who seemed to have what might be called a sheepish grin on his
sunburned face.</p>

<p>“I made a fool play, and got pitched over the head of my pony, when he
stepped into a gopher hole. Broke a leg, that’s all; reckons as how I
orter broke my fool neck to even her up. Have to get you boys to help me
off the hoss. Never knew that to happen before to a feller my size. Mr.
Witherspoon, he did her up in fust class shape, and sez he, ‘You get back
to the ranch the best way you can, and the boys’ll do what’s needed, with
the help of Mrs. Ogden.’ So if you’ll jest give me a hand, mebbe I might
hop inside the bunk house.”</p>

<p>“No you don’t,” said impulsive Andy, instantly, “you’ll go right in the
main house. Guess I know what Uncle Jethro’d do if he was here. That bunk
house may be all right for a well puncher, but with its noisy crowd it’s
no place for a man with a broken leg. Now, rest your whole
weight on us, Joe; we can stand it, all right. That’s the way; hope it
didn’t hurt much when you dropped out of the saddle. Now, use us like you
would a pair of crutches, and we’ll get there, step by step.”</p>

<p>The housekeeper and little Becky came running out just then, alarmed by
seeing Alkali Joe, who was something of a favorite on the ranch, in dire
straits. Even Charley Woo was solicitous about the comfort of the injured
man, and hurried in with Mrs. Ogden to get a bed ready in the spare
room.</p>

<p>After the boys had gotten the cow puncher in bed, Frank took a look at
the way Mr. Witherspoon had bound up the broken leg.</p>

<p>“Why, your uncle must be a regular surgeon, Andy!” he declared, “that’s
as neat a job as I ever saw; and done while on the gallop, too, you might
say. I take off my hat to Uncle Jethro, let me tell you right now.”</p>

<p>“We all do that, Frank,” said Joe, emphatically. “He’s the most
wonderful man in the whole country. There ain’t a puncher that ever worked
for him as wouldn’t go through fire and flood for Mr. Witherspoon; well, I
take that back, ’cause I reckon they has been one or two as he had to
fire, and for mighty good reasons, that’d like to see him
lose all his stock through a norther, or else that Mexican cattle
rustler.”</p>

<p>Inside half an hour the injured man had been made as comfortable as
possible; he himself said it was the greatest snap that had ever befallen
him, and that he hadn’t lain between soft white sheets since he was a kid
at home in the East. Frank thought that old memories were being stirred in
Joe’s mind; perhaps, after all, his accident might work for his good, in
that it would cause him to recollect that there was an old mother or
father somewhere east of the Mississippi, whom he had almost forgotten,
and who would be wild with joy if only a letter came from the boy who had
gone away from home so many years ago, and in the excitement of his life
in the Southwest shut out all thoughts of the past from his heart.</p>

<p>Frank and Andy after having lunch sat outside where the shadows were
thickest at this sweltering time of day. There could always be found a
gentle puff of air at this favorite place; and lounging in a hammock,
while Andy worked at some of his prints, Frank watched a lone white cloud
that was drifting across the azure sky above.</p>

<p>Perhaps his thoughts too were turning back to other
scenes as he lay there. It might be that the sight of that single fleecy
fog-like vapor caused him to remember events that were connected with
other scenes in the lively experiences which had come to the Bird boys
while harnessing their chariot to the clouds.</p>

<p>“What you thinking about, Frank?” Andy asked, suddenly, after he had
been watching the face of his cousin for a full minute without the other
knowing it.</p>

<p>“Why, I was trying to picture rough Alkali Joe in the past,” replied
Frank. “What he said about not having slept between sheets since he was a
kid, made me think. Did you see that picture that fell out of his pocket
when we took off his Mexican jacket, the one he won at the raffle they
told us about?”</p>

<p>“Sure I did; but that wasn’t Joe’s best girl, Frank; when I picked it
up and put it back I saw that it was the face of an elderly woman.”</p>

<p>“All the same it ought to be Joe’s best girl; because I reckon it’s his
mother. And I remember him saying one day that he didn’t know whether
there was anybody alive in his family or not, because he hadn’t written a
letter home for six whole years. And Andy, I was just thinking, that while
he’s on his back there, it might be a good time to get talking to Joe,
 and see if he wouldn’t think to write. If his mother’s alive
still, I reckon she’d be happy to hear from him again.”</p>

<p>“Frank, that’s just like you for all the world; always wanting to do
somebody a good turn. Now, that wouldn’t have struck me at all; but since
you’ve mentioned it, I’m going to watch my chance to get talking about
home and all such things, and see if I can’t wake Joe up. He’s a
good-hearted fellow, if he is tough. But by the way you’re getting back to
your old self, I think the chances look good for our making that start
tomorrow in the biplane.”</p>

<p>“It does look that way, if nothing happens between now and then to
break up our plans,” replied the other. “Doctor Witherspoon has certainly
knocked that dizziness out of my system, and I’m as well as ever now. Fact
is, there’s a little job connected with the motor that ought to be
attended to, to put it in first-class condition, and when the sun gets
lower down, so that a fellow can breathe better, why I think I’ll get
busy.”</p>

<p>“And me to help you,” chirped Andy, promptly, “I’m about done with this
printing business anyway. Say, what d’ye think of this lot of pictures?
Don’t it give you a cold chill just to look at that old grizzly scattering
things around at the mouth of his den? And every time I
glimpse Buckskin hanging on to that log bridge with his fingers and teeth,
trying to climb back again after losing his balance, it makes me shake all
over, I want to laugh so hard. A pretty good lot all told, Frank.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they are; Andy, and the folks at home will have a fine
time looking them over. You’ll be able to illustrate nearly every big yarn
you have to tell; and the round-up tomorrow ought to just fill out the
bill. But I can make use of you, if you care to come over with me to the
hangar. An air has started up, you notice, and it doesn’t feel quite so
hot,” and accompanied by his cousin, after Andy had put his prints and
trays away in the house, Frank sauntered leisurely over to where stood the
new shed, which had been built to shelter the precious aeroplane wonder.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='An Alarming Discovery' id='chXVI'>
CHAPTER XVI—AN ALARMING DISCOVERY
</h2>

<p>Long before evening came on Frank had completed his work, and
pronounced the aeroplane in as near perfect condition as it could be
placed.</p>

<p>Andy had some more prints to worry over after supper, but it was a
labor of love with him, and he never wearied of it. There was such a
fascination about seeing the many well remembered scenes flash up before
him, after he had dropped the paper in the tray holding his developing
solution, and then carefully manipulating them so as to bring out the best
possible results, that Frank declared he would have to drag him to bed
later on.</p>

<p>They spent a very pleasant evening. Mrs. Ogden played the piano, and
Frank was able to do some little execution with the violin which Mr.
Witherspoon himself could manipulate so cleverly. Andy thumped on a banjo,
and even sang a few college songs, such as the boys of Bloomsbury High
delighted to learn in anticipation of the time when they would go away to
Yale, Harvard, Cornell, or possibly Princeton, according to the mood that
influenced them in making a choice. When Charley Woo was
discovered by little Becky crouching in the doorway and evidently enjoying
the music, he was induced to bring a native Chinese instrument, fashioned
after the manner of a mandolin from which he managed to extract some weird
kind of music almost barbaric in its way, which added more or less to the
enjoyment of the evening, and made the player superlatively happy.</p>

<p>As the door of the room where Alkali Joe lay upon his bed was kept
open, so that he could enjoy the music, they heard him clapping his hands
for some time after each air.</p>

<p>Purposely Frank influenced Mrs. Ogden to sing “Home, Sweet Home,” with
himself and Andy coming in on the chorus, as well as the sweet, bird-like
tones of little Becky’s voice. She gave promise of quite some talent in
the line of music, and would carol half the day in her childish way.</p>

<p>And Frank listening heard no applause after they were through; instead,
there was a dense silence beyond that open door, as though something about
the song had touched the hardened heart of the cow puncher, and started
him to thinking of things that had long banished from his mind.</p>

<p>Even Andy noticed the suggestive silence, and catching
the eye of his cousin, nodded his head in the direction of the room where
the injured man lay, while he smiled, as much as to say:</p>

<p>“That was a center-shot, Frank; you hit the bull’s-eye that time, old
fellow, and chances are that now he’s got to thinking, Joe isn’t going to
be able to forget again in a hurry. You mark my words, there’ll be a call
for paper and pen inside of a day or two.”</p>

<p>And sure enough, though there may be no further opportunity to mention
the matter again, on account of other stirring scenes that await our
attention, it can be stated right here and now that Alkali Joe did write a
letter home before another forty-eight hours had expired. So that the
little accident of his being pitched over the head of his pony when the
animal stepped into a gopher hole, while going at a round pace, was the
means of bringing joy to the heart of a grieving old mother in a far-away
Eastern State.</p>

<p>Strange that not one of them noticed a face that was pressed close to
the corner of the open sash of the window in the back of the room, from
time to time, a dark scowling face that was marked by glittering eyes,
which seemed to be fastened on the little sprite of a girl
whenever she danced across the floor.</p>

<p>No one dreamed of anything like danger, when the atmosphere seemed so
calm and delightful. But then, that is the way things often go; and many
times the gathering storm steals up unobserved, until there is a savage
burst of thunder, accompanied by a vivid flash of lightning, startling
every one by its sudden coming.</p>

<p>Finally Mrs. Ogden declared that the hour had grown late for little
Becky to be up; and as was her custom, the winsome child went to each of
the boys to kiss him goodnight.</p>

<p>After that Frank picked up a book, and interested himself in the story;
while Andy, unable to tear himself away from his beloved camera work,
started to print again, having another batch of proofs from which he had
not as yet taken pictures.</p>

<p>The face at the window did not appear again after the housekeeper and
little Becky left the living-room. It might be assumed from this that the
spy without had lost all interest in the occupants when the child vanished
from view.</p>

<p>Frank read on until he found his eyes growing heavy. Then with a yawn
he tossed the book on the table. “Ten o’clock, Andy,” he
remarked, as a gentle reminder.</p>

<p>“Oh! that isn’t late,” said the other, “you know, we go to bed at all
hours at our house at home. A doctor never knows when he can get a night’s
sleep; and that breaks up things in his family more or less. But I’m on
the home stretch with this batch of prints, Frank. Give me a little more
time, won’t you? When I get started with my trays and chemicals I like to
clean up a lot of stuff.”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes more,” remarked Frank, grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh! well p’raps I can get through then; but even if I don’t you might
sneak off, and leave me to put out the glim when I am through,” the other
went on to say.</p>

<p>“Not if I know myself and I think I do, likewise you,” chuckled Frank.
“Why, you never would come to bed till long after midnight. It’d be just
one more batch, and then another after that, to the wind-up. I’ll wait for
you, my boy. Ten minutes, and then we’ll close up shop.”</p>

<p>Andy knew that his cousin would stick to his word; he had been up
against it more than a few times in the past, and so he hurried matters as
much as he could. When the ten minutes had expired he begged
for five more, as grace, saying that he would just spoil the few prints
that had to be finished if they were left in the washing water until
morning; and so Frank gave in that far.</p>

<p>When they were undressing, later on, Frank thrust his head out of the
window to look at the glory of the moonlight night, and wonder what the
boys were doing in the round-up camp, just then.</p>

<p>The night was now cool and pleasant, as they frequently are after a hot
day in Arizona, especially about the Fall season. Stars shone softly
above, and there the moon hung like a big lantern, lighting up the earth
below.</p>

<p>How many memories did it not recall to the Bird boys, every time they
looked up and saw that great yellow shield! Had they not looked upon it
under various periods of stress and peril in their own lives; sometimes
near the home town, and again it might be far away in the mysterious
country bordering the Magdalena river, down in Colombia, where the
tropical sun shone far hotter than it did here in the Arizona regions.</p>

<p>Often the Bird boys were influenced to talk of these past experiences,
when the mood came upon them; but Andy usually became more
 or less excited whenever he was reminded of these stirring
events; and tonight Frank wisely refrained from starting him going by
mentioning the memories that were awakened by that lovely round orb.</p>

<p>The last thing he remembered Andy saying was that it promised to be a
good day for the little air voyage they contemplated taking on the morrow;
which caused Frank to chuckle, because in this arid country, where it
seldom rained, all days were good ones, save as the heat or blowing alkali
dust might bring discomfort in their train.</p>

<p>When Frank awoke again it was broad day. He no longer was troubled with
that dizzy feeling; and yet it seemed to him as though a weight might be
pressing down upon him. The air was unusually bracing on this particular
morning, too, so that Frank did not know what to make of it.</p>

<p>Not being a boy given to such a things as the “blues,” he shook himself
with the intention of getting rid of this feeling and sternly put it out
of his mind.</p>

<p>They went outdoors to take a look around, while waiting for Charley Woo
to call them to breakfast. He was already up and doing, as the smoke from
the kitchen chimney told. Indeed, there was an unmistakable
smell of cooking in the air that caused Andy to sniff eagerly, and
remark:</p>

<p>“Tell me, don’t that coffee smell fine; and as sure as you live,
Charley Woo is going to give us a mess of his famous flapjacks, too. When
we go away from here, Frank, we’ll have to send that Chink something nice,
to pay him for all he’s done to make us happy while on the ranch. I really
think Charlie’d lie awake all night hatching up some new mess to tickle us
with. Uncle struck a treasure when that moon-eyed Celestial came wandering
along here looking for a berth, when the tough punchers of the M-bar-M
outfit chased him off because he let a hair from his queue get in the
soup.”</p>

<p>Presently the call came for breakfast, and the boys hurried in to
attack the eggs and bacon and pancakes that were spread before them;
together with butter, rolls, coffee, and genuine maple syrup, of which
latter article the ranchman was very fond.</p>

<p>They wondered a little that Mrs. Ogden was not with them, but all the
same proceeded to do full justice to Charley Woo’s cooking. The grinning
Chinaman waited on them with his customary agility, almost anticipating
their wants, and insisting on piling more flapjacks on their
plates as fast as they were emptied, until both boys had to hold their
hands over them and vow that they could not devour another one for love or
money.</p>

<p>“Suppose you go and knock on Mrs. Ogden’s door at the other end of the
house, and tell her the cakes will get cold is she doesn’t come quick,”
suggested Andy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I never knew her to be sleeping in so, since we’ve been here,”
added Frank, and yet as Charley Woo, who could make himself handy about
the house in the capacity of a man of all work as well as chef, hurried
off to carry out the suggestion, neither of the boys had the slightest
suspicion that anything out of the way was the matter.</p>

<p>The first thing they knew about trouble was when they heard the
Chinaman shouting in a wild fashion; and jumping up, regardless of the
heavy meal they had just devoured, they ran through the passage to where
the sound came from, their hearts almost standing still with sudden
apprehension, they knew not what of.</p>

<p>The outer door of the two rooms which were occupied by the housekeeper
and little blue-eyed Becky was open, and as Frank and Andy burst through
impetuously, they saw Charley Woo, trying to unwind some
pieces of rope which had evidently been used to bind Mrs. Ogden to the bed
posts. A towel with which she had possibly been gagged lay on the floor.
The poor woman was in her wrapper, and so completely exhausted that she
could hardly make a sound. But evidently she wanted to tell them something
important, for her lips kept on moving; and Frank, bending down managed to
catch the sense of the whispered sounds.</p>

<p>No wonder his face was white as he turned his head, and looked at his
cousin.</p>

<p>“She says little Becky has been kidnapped!” was what he flung at Andy.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='The Carrying Off of Little Becky' id='chXVII'>
CHAPTER XVII—THE CARRYING OFF OF LITTLE BECKY
</h2>

<p>Andy fell back and stared at his cousin helplessly when he heard this
startling announcement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Frank had started in to assist Charley Woo cut the rope which
had been so cruelly used to make the housekeeper a prisoner. Then he
helped her to regain her feet, for she had sank down utterly exhausted as
soon as released.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Ogden was a sensible woman, and she was trying the best she
knew how to recover her speech; so that presently Frank thought it time to
ask her something about what had happened.</p>

<p>“He must have crept in through the open window!” she gasped. “I thought
the night wind had started blowing the blind, and got up to fix it, when
he caught hold of me, and that was the last I knew until I came to my
senses and found myself bound, and with a towel fastened across my face so
that I could not cry out, when he was just passing out of the window. In
the moonlight I could see that he held a bundle in his arms, and I knew
what it must be. Oh! what will Mr. Witherspoon say when he
learns how I have let that sweet child be taken away from under my
eyes.”</p>

<p>That seemed to be the main cause for her distress; she thought nothing
at all about her own sufferings, but was only concerned about what her
employer would think because she had not been able to prevent the
kidnapping of the child.</p>

<p>Though Andy had not yet recovered his voice, and was groping in the
dark with regard to what it all meant, Frank, clearer visioned, had
already made a pretty straight guess. He immediately started to ask a few
questions, and each one of them went straight to the point.</p>

<p>“Did you see the man clearly, Mrs. Ogden?” he demanded; and somehow the
housekeeper seemed to feel something of the same confidence in Frank that
his manner nearly always produced in those who were in distress.</p>

<p>“No, because the moon was on the other side of the house,” she replied;
“and besides, he seemed to have some sort of bandanna handkerchief
fastened around the lower part of his face as a disguise.”</p>

<p>“And did he say anything that you heard, anything that would give you a
clue with regard to who he was?” Frank went on to ask. “I
remember that when he first caught me by the throat he did utter a low
word, and it was a Mexican word, too,” she answered, slowly, as though her
mind might not yet be working as clearly as usual.</p>

<p>“That is a point, then, to be remembered,” the boy insisted, “and
here’s something that might give us another clue.”</p>

<p>He picked an object up from the floor, and held it aloft.</p>

<p>“A Mexican sombrero!” exclaimed Andy, recovering his speech at
last.</p>

<p>“Just what it is,” said Frank, steadily, “and as is the habit with
these men from over the border, this one is decorated heavily with silver
beads, and gold buttons, as well as filigree work. One of these hats is
worth a lot of money, and the owner is as proud of it as a lady would be
of her magnificent diamonds at the opera. Please try and think, Mrs.
Ogden, did you ever see this sombrero before?”</p>

<p>He held it up in front of her eyes, slowly turning it around, so that
she might observe every part in turn.</p>

<p>The housekeeper uttered a low bubbling cry. Evidently the truth had 
flashed into her mind, and she was no longer groping in the dark. “Yes, 
yes, I do remember seeing that hat, Frank, Andy!” she exclaimed.</p> 

<p>“On the head of a certain gentleman who went by the name of Jose
Sandero?” pursued the boy, as if trying to aid her memory.</p>

<p>“No other, though it was some years ago!” she cried. “They always
decorate each new hat in the same way as the last. And when he was here
that time to demand his child, only to hear that the court had given her
into the keeping of Mr. Witherspoon, Jose Sandero wore just such a
sombrero. Oh! it was him, all right; and the poor little darling has been
carried off by her own unworthy father. He will make for the border as
fast as horses can carry him, hoping to be safe beyond the line before the
return of Mr. Witherspoon.”</p>

<p>Frank had already guessed this much. It looked like a serious
proposition; but then he was a boy not easily daunted. The more difficult
the task the greater was Frank Bird’s resolution apt to be aroused.</p>

<p>First of all it seemed essential that the ranchman must be notified of
what had happened and that as quickly as possible. They were many miles
away, and doubtless much valuable time would be lost, even after the
messenger reached the round-up camp, since the boys would be
off here and there engaged in their work of gathering the cattle for the
purpose of picking out unbranded stock, and driving it in to be marked,
after it had been roped and thrown.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it was necessary that they find out if possible which way
the kidnapper had gone; though the chances were ten to one the
direction would be south. There were several reasons for believing this.
In the first place Mexico lay in that quarter; and doubtless across the
border Jose Sandero had prepared a hiding place where he could defy the
United States courts to summon him. Perhaps he also had friends and
comrades awaiting him there, who would defend him against any pursuit of
the Double X Ranch cow punchers, bent on recovering the child and
punishing the bold abductor.</p>

<p>Frank stepped over to the window, and looked out.</p>

<p>It happened that just below the earth was soft, for Mr. Witherspoon had
made a brave effort to have certain flowering shrubs bloom near the house,
and several pink oleanders and scarlet hibiscus did manage to survive the
heat, being carefully watered each morning and evening by Charley Woo with
his hose. And looking closely Frank could see the mark of
footprints. He climbed out of the window and began to follow them, Andy
being quickly at his side, bubbling over with indignation and breathing
all sorts of dire threats against the bad man who had for some reason
other than affection chosen to steal the child to whom he no longer had
any claim, selecting the very time when the punchers would be far away
from the ranch house, which he had expected would be practically left
unprotected.</p>

<p>Frank kept on following the tracks until finally he came to the now
almost empty corral, where the riding horses were kept when the boys were
at home.</p>

<p>“See,” Frank observed, “here is where he had his pony tied—there were
two of them, Andy, showing that he came here with the intention of
carrying little Becky off.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Andy, “and now we ought to learn which way he went. But
Frank, there’s hardly a pony fit to ride except Alkali Joe’s mount in the
corral. They took every one along for use in the rough work of the
round-up. Uncle says he will have to break in a lot more right away.
They’ve been losing a large number lately, you remember. Heads into the
south, don’t it, Frank?”</p>
  
<p>“Yes, just as I thought it would,” muttered the other coming to a 
stand, and looking away off over the level stretch of plain, as though he 
wished he had eyes strong enough to discover the fleeing marauder, miles 
and miles away though he must be before now.</p> 

<p>“Poor little Becky, how frightened she must be to find herself being
carried off by that man,” remarked Andy, his voice trembling with feeling;
and he had to stop speaking to grit his teeth, as anger almost overwhelmed
him. “Of course he’s told her before now that he is her father; but that
won’t make her feel any better, because she has heard enough from the boys
to know that Jose is a bad man, who deserted her mother, and was in one
way the cause of her death. Whatever do you suppose he did it for, Frank;
not that he could care about Becky, who looks too much like her mother did
to ever make him love her? More’n likely now, he’s gone to all this
trouble, and risked his neck in the bargain, just to get even with Uncle
Jethro.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be much surprised if you’ve hit the nail on the head,
Andy,” observed the other soberly. “But the question is, what are we going
to do about it, for it seems to me it’s up to us pretty much
to start something moving.”</p>

<p>Andy suddenly looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Frank!” he exclaimed, “we’ve got something better than
ponies to take us over the ground to where Uncle Jethro and the boys are
at work. What’s going to hinder us from making use of the biplane to cover
these miles of space? Why, we can just whizz down there, and carry the
news!”</p>

<p>Frank appeared to be thinking, for he did not make any remark in answer
to this bright suggestion on the part of his chum.</p>

<p>“Look,” Andy went on to remark, “if there isn’t Alkali Joe hobbling
around on one foot with a cane to support him. Chances are, he’ll be
asking us to let him ride for help, while we try and overtake the
kidnapper; but that would be a terrible thing to let him do. Better send
Charley Woo, if somebody has to go, and you don’t want to waste time by
using the machine.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking why shouldn’t we set out straight on the track of Jose,
using the biplane instead of ponies?” Frank suddenly broke out with.</p>

<p>“Good! Great stunt! It does take you to think up things, Frank. There I
kept on beating about the bush, and saying we might carry
the news to the boys, when all the time we had the opening before us to
chase right after the skunk, hot-footed. And say, there’s those fine
Marlin guns we used on the bear hunt; couldn’t we make out to carry a
couple of that sort along with us, Frank? Oh! the way I feel right now, it
wouldn’t take much to tempt me to put a chunk of lead in that Mexican, I
tell you. How about that, Frank; ain’t we going armed, if we have to try
and get our little ranch butterfly back again?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Andy; it would be silly to think of going without some sort
of gun along. When you’re meaning to arrest a bad man you had ought to
make sure you’re heeled so as to enforce your demands. We’ll take
shooting-irons along in numbers enough to riddle him if it comes to a
question of a stand-up fight. And now’s let’s hurry back to the house.
Before we can get off there are a few things we must see to, you
understand.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think we had better run over to where the boys are,
first of all, and let them know?” Andy went on to ask, loth to let his
suggestion be wholly thrown into the discard.</p>

<p>“A waste of time, when everything is going to depend on
how fast we can overtake Jose and little Becky,” Frank asserted, firmly.
“We can start Charley Woo off; or if necessary, Mrs. Ogden, who can ride
nearly as well as a man, will go. Come, the sooner we start in the quicker
we’ll be able to do something worth while.”</p>

<p>And Andy, duly impressed once more with the fact that Frank was able to
handle the situation, if any one could, only too gladly hurried after his
cousin when the latter headed for the house.</p>

<p>No one paid the least attention to the fact that it was a fine airy
morning, for the catastrophe which had come upon Double X Ranch so
suddenly had by this time filled their minds to the exclusion of
everything else.</p>

<p>And it was an excited group that gathered by the horse block in front
of the door—the housekeeper wringing her hands in anguish; Frank and Andy
looking very determined; Charley Woo in a flutter; and Alkali Joe furious
because of his crippled condition.</p>

</div>

<h2 title='The Aeroplane Pursuit' id='chXVIII'>
CHAPTER XVIII—THE AEROPLANE PURSUIT
</h2>

<p>“But ain’t you a-goin’ to let me ride over and tell the boss what’s
happened?” complained Alkali Joe, after Frank had in as few words as
possible explained just what he and Andy meant to do; and while this was
taking place his cousin had slipped into the house to secure the coveted
guns, the value of which they knew only too well after that excitement
over the bear hunt.</p>

<p>“You never could make it, Joe,” said Mrs. Ogden decisively, “chances
are you’d give that leg a wrench on the way, and just faint from the pain.
Besides, it would be a crying shame to let a wounded man gallop all day
long nearly, or even for a few hours. I’d sooner ride myself than let you
try it.”</p>

<p>“How about you, Charley Woo; can you ride a pony, and follow as plain a
trail as the bunch left behind them?” asked Frank, turning to the
Chinaman.</p>

<p>Charley Woo nodded his head so violently that his dangling queue looked
like an animated rope hanging down his back. He removed his
 hands with their long fingernails, from the wide sleeves of
the jacket he wore.</p>

<p>“Sure tling, Flank!” he exclaimed eagerly, delighted it seemed to have
such confidence reposed in him; “him know where Mistah Withasploon camp
las’ night; been samee place much many tlimes ’long with him. Go there
light away, fast as Joe, he pony run. Tell when, that all.”</p>

<p>Alkali opened his mouth to object to his favorite cayuse being ridden
by another than himself, and a miserable “Chink” at that; then he shut his
teeth hard together as he remembered what it all meant, and how foolish he
would be to throw any obstacle in the way of the rescue of the little
sunbeam that had been the idol of the ranch for some years now.</p>

<p>Frank himself hurried off to rope the pony in the corral. He had
learned how to do this almost as well as any of the cow punchers
themselves; and quickly made his reappearance leading the mount that had
played havoc with his master’s limb when he failed to detect the gopher
hole in the trail. The little animal was showing all the signs of anger at
being caught by anyone other than the master he acknowledged, but Frank
had no time to waste, and had handled him without gloves. 
Charley Woo did not seem to be one whit afraid because the pony snorted
and tried to bite him when he approached. Watching his chance, when all
was ready, the nimble Chinaman made a flying leap for the saddle that
would have done credit to Alkali Joe himself. He had a quirt in his hand,
secured by a stout buckskin thong to his wrist; and no sooner did he
clutch the bridle than he brought this leather torment down upon the
horse’s heaving flank with a vicious smack.</p>

<p>At the same instant Frank released his grip, and away the pony flew,
the huddled figure of the Chinaman dressed in his white, flapping
garments, on his back, with his long queue flying out behind like a
rope.</p>

<p>“He’s headed straight to begin with,” said Andy, with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>“Charley Woo is all right,” declared Frank, “and sooner or later he’ll
get to where Mr. Witherspoon is camped, to carry him the news.”</p>

<p>“He will if that pony don’t play some smart trick on him,” muttered
Alkali Joe, frowning. “You orter let me try it, Frank; I’m tough as knots,
and I reckon I’d a-stood it.”</p>

<p>“You get back to your bed as fast as you can, Joe,” returned Frank.
“Right now, perhaps you’ve put back the knitting of that bone,
 and it may have to be set all over again when Mr.
Witherspoon gets a chance to look at it. Come along, Andy, we’ve got our
job laid out for us.”</p>

<p>Joe still leaned against the hitching rail, and looked longingly after
the Bird boys. From the gloom on his dark face, and the twitching of the
muscles around his mouth, it could be plainly seen that the puncher was
taking his misfortune with a bad grace; and that he thought himself the
most badly used fellow inside of fifty miles; all because he had not been
allowed to make that mad dash of twenty or more miles in a broiling sun,
with a broken leg dangling uselessly at his side; and had to suffer the
mortification of seeing a “heathen Chinee” gallop away on his pony. It
must have been a cruel experience for Alkali Joe, and one that he would
not soon forget either.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two young aviators hurried over to the frame building
that Mr. Witherspoon had had erected before their coming, and which was to
be used as a hangar for their precious biplane.</p>

<p>“How lucky, Frank that you overhauled the motor only yesterday,”
remarked Andy, as they reached the wide doors of the shed which, upon
being thrown open would allow of the aeroplane being
wheeled out to where they usually started off.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking that myself,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Just like you seemed to believe we might have a sudden call for
service,” went on Andy.</p>

<p>“Hardly that,” Frank sent back over his shoulder, as he dove inside the
building, “you know my maxim is to be ready always, for you never know
when the emergency is going to jump out at you. These things nearly always
drop down like a bolt of lightning from a clear sky.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Frank. But there’s nothing wrong here, is there?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t seem to be,” and Frank, who had hurriedly moved about from one
side of the aeroplane to the other, sighed with relief, and so loud that
Andy heard him.</p>

<p>“But you were afraid there might be, own up now, Frank?” he exclaimed,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t know but that Jose might have made his way in here last
night and damaged the biplane. He sure would if he’d known how we could
use it to chase after him, five times as fast as he could go on his pony.
You know how easy it is to put such a thing out of commission, Andy. And
Jose must have been prowling about here while we were
asleep.”</p>

<p>“Wonder how it was Tige didn’t scent him, and give him a chase?”
remarked Andy, referring to the faithful watch dog that as a usual thing,
played the part of sentinel over the ranch house, when the night grew old,
and every inmate slept.</p>

<p>“Which reminds me that we haven’t seen the old fellow this morning,
Andy.”</p>

<p>“Great governor! that’s a fact!” exclaimed the other, excitedly. “Say,
I wouldn’t put it past that yellow-faced Mexican kidnapper to poison poor
old Tige. When they come to look, chances are they’ll find him lying stiff
in his kennel.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got no time to talk that over now, Andy,” said the other.
“Lend a hand and we’ll trundle the thing out to the starting place. Plenty
of gasolene aboard, you know, because I filled the reserve tank yesterday,
thank goodness. Here comes Mrs. Ogden with a package in her hand.”</p>

<p>“Bet you I know what she’s got!” exclaimed Andy; “thinks we might get
lost somewhere out on the desert, and she’s made us up a lot of grub to
carry along. Wait till I look and see if there’s plenty of water in that
jug I fixed to the back of the seat. Yes, brimful, I’ll tie
the guns here. Wait for me just three minutes, won’t you, Frank? I’m going
back to the house.”</p>

<p>“What notion have you got in your head now, Andy?” demanded the other a
little impatiently.</p>

<p>“We ought to have the glasses, you know,” came back to him.</p>

<p>“You’re right, and it was a good thing you thought of them,” called
Frank, only too well pleased to commend his chum for a thing of this
kind.</p>

<p>Andy fairly ran at top speed toward the house, and plunged in through
the open door, not wanting to waste a second more than could be helped. He
was back again at the hangar before the time allowance he had given
himself had expired; and so on arriving found that Frank had made all
other preparation necessary, so that there was now nothing to prevent
their immediate start.</p>

<p>“Oh! how I will pray that you get back our little darling safe and
unharmed!” the housekeeper called out to them, as they were taking their
places.</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Witherspoon when you see him that we mean to do everything we
can to bring little Becky back home,” Frank said, as his
last words.</p>

<p>“And look up poor old Tige,” called Andy, “just as like as not you’ll
have to bury him, because he must be dead; or else chased after the boys
last night.”</p>

<p>Frank gave the word; each of them had a part to do in the successful
starting of the aeroplane; as the little motor burst into a merry song
they found themselves commencing to move slowly along the level ground.
Faster and faster grew the pace until Frank, deeming that the time had
come to mount upward, changed the planes, and immediately the clever flier
left the ground, rising gradually until he felt able to increase the
speed, and climb upward in spirals.</p>

<p>The first thing that seemed advisable in Frank’s mind was to get some
sort of bird’s-eye view of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Of course he and Andy had done considerable moving about in all
directions since first coming to Arizona, so that Frank already had a
pretty fair knowledge of the vicinity. But with the glasses to help out,
he hoped to be in a position to discover several things.</p>

<p>“Get busy, Andy, and see what you can glimpse,” he remarked, after they
had succeeded in mounting upward to a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>“I’ve already sighted Charley Woo,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“I hope then he’s going right along,” remarked Frank, anxiously, for
his attention had to be confined almost exclusively to the working of the
aeroplane, and on this account he must depend on his chum to tell him what
was happening.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Andy hastened to reply, “he’s still hanging to Joe’s cayuse like
a flea, and as far as I can see, whooping it up at the liveliest pace
ever. But I’m looking away beyond him to find out if I can see the
boys.”</p>

<p>“Well, how about it?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“Wait till we swing around again, and I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>They were by now high enough to afford quite an extended view in every
direction. Frank’s eyes had sought the south whenever he had a chance to
take them for a second or two from his work; but Andy was leveling the
glasses in almost an opposite quarter.</p>

<p>“There! I’ve just glimpsed a lot of small objects moving this way and
that,” he announced suddenly, “which I take it are cattle, with the
punchers rushing them wherever they want. But they’re a
whole heap of miles away, Frank. Guess they see us by now, and expect
we’re going to sail up that way. Perhaps they’ll wonder to watch us turn
right around and go off to the south. Is it really necessary, Frank?
Couldn’t we run up there and let them know?”</p>

<p>“What would be the use?” returned his cousin. “They could never catch
Jose, mounted on their ponies, and him with all that start. Why, I’m only
afraid he’ll be able to cross over into Mexico before we get up with him,
for all our swiftness with our humming motor. And minutes are apt to count
big in this game, Andy, so I say we’d better not lose any time running
over there, and then going down to let them know what’s happened. Charley
Woo is on the job, and he’ll get there sooner or later with the news.”</p>

<p>And so Andy said nothing more along those lines.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='Over Plain and Desert' id='chXIX'>
CHAPTER XIX—OVER PLAIN AND DESERT
</h2>

<p>“I think we’re high enough up now!” observed Frank, presently.</p>

<p>He no longer sent the biplane in widening circles, boring steadily
upwards; but turned toward the south and pushed for speed, as far as was
compatible with safety, which was always Frank’s way.</p>

<p>And Andy seemed to have now lost all interest in what lay behind, for
he was looking ahead through the glasses, as though in the hope of
discovering the kidnapper of little Becky somewhere in the hazy
distance.</p>

<p>It was still comparatively early in the morning, and in places there
lay an odd sort of mist that may have been a mirage, obscuring the view,
since the earth was hidden in its whitish folds.</p>

<p>Away beyond these spots did Andy turn his marine glasses. Now he saw
something moving that at first gave him a little shock; but on second
inspection it turned out to be a sailing buzzard, evidently scenting some
carrion in a bunch of sage brush, that gave promise of
 dinner, since it was close to the earth at the time.</p>

<p>A minute later and Andy had another start, as once more he believed he
had discovered an object that certainly crawled over the ground. Could it
be some wounded man, or one who was perishing for a drink of water, in
that arid land bordering the desert?</p>

<p>But hardly had this thought occurred to Andy than he realized his
mistake; for he now saw that it was only a cowardly coyote, shuffling
along as though ashamed to be caught returning to his den at such an hour
of the morning, after an all night feast, perhaps.</p>

<p>Down below them they could see the plain which formed a part of Double
X Ranch. It looked like a great checkerboard, on account of the different
colors of the soil, which stood out in relief when one was directly above.
Had there been any water there they could have seen to the very bottom,
even though it were twenty feet deep, such is the advantage which this
lofty position gives. No wonder, thought Andy, that the hawk is able to
pick out just the fish he wants for his dinner, and then finds it so easy
to pounce down upon the unfortunate thus selected.</p>

<p>Frank was listening to the buzz of the motor. Whenever
they were thus humming along through space this was his favorite
occupation. And indeed, when one stops to consider how much depended on
the successful operation of that same industrious engine, he could be
easily excused for taking such intense interest in its labors. Let it
suddenly get out of condition and it would bring the daring young aviators
face to face with a crisis that might threaten even their lives. Deprived
of the means of making progress would necessitate a volplane toward the
ground, always a dangerous performance and one that should only be
attempted when the conditions are all favorable, or some desperate need
arises.</p>

<p>Turn whichever way Andy would nothing but disappointment seemed to meet
him; and being pretty much an impulsive boy, perhaps it was only natural
that he should voice his disgust.</p>

<p>“Oh! I wouldn’t give that any worry,” Frank told him. “If Jose has had
as much time as we think, he must be away ahead of the line of your
observation just now, especially on account of all that haze along the
horizon.”</p>

<p>“But if we can’t see him, how are we to know that we’re keeping in a
direct line after him?” demanded the one who wielded the glasses.
 “We can only take our chances,” Frank answered, steadily,
as though he did not mean to be ruffled so early in the game, when so many
things remained untried, any one of which might sooner or later prove to
be the magic key, fated to unlock the treasure chest.</p>

<p>“And just keep on heading south, is that it, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Exactly so, Andy. We’re about dead sure that it’s Jose who carried
away Little Sunbeam; and knowing that, we can figure he’s sure to make a
bee line for the nearest place where the border comes. So I’m shaping our
course for that same region myself. And when we get there, perhaps we’ll
find we’ve been left in the lurch and that his fast ponies have won the
day.”</p>

<p>“And what then, Frank; would we have to turn around and come back like
a dog with his tail between his legs, just because the kidnapper managed
to quit American soil, and get on that belonging to Mexico? As for me, I’d
be willing to give him the merry chase right down along the line till we
landed in Mexico City, or else in a Black Hole in some town on the
way.”</p>

<p>“I feel pretty much the same way, Andy; but first of all, you see,
we’ve just got to find out where the man and child are. So
keep on looking while I drive her along a little faster. I think we can
stand another turn, with this light and favorable breeze carrying us with
it.”</p>

<p>For several minutes no one said a single word. Frank was busy with his
motor, while Andy had his eyes fairly glued to the small end of the
glasses, as though he kept hoping that he would make a pleasing discovery
the very next minute.</p>

<p>Now even the ranch building would be found to look very small and far
to their rear, did they bother glancing back that way, which, to tell the
truth, neither of them did.</p>

<p>And at the same time the rough country came closer, until one could see
where the fertile plain really ended, and the sandy desert began.</p>

<p>Unless one made a very wide detour it was absolutely necessary to cross
over this arid waste in order to reach the Mexican border. Frank had been
figuring it all out. He believed that Jose, being a bold and audacious
man, would not think of taking the longer route. In the first place that
course was apt to keep him exposed to the hot pursuit which he knew he
could count on as the result of his audacious exploit. And doubtless Jose
was fully aware of the reputation those hard riding cow punchers connected
with the Double X Ranch had as trackers and fighters too, on
occasion. What they had done to the Mexican cattle rustlers must have made
a reputation for them across the border; so that Jose knew what chances he
was taking when he started in to steal his daughter, which the court had
given over into the keeping of her relative, Mr. Witherspoon.</p>

<p>And Andy was not a great while in making the discovery that they were
now approaching the confines of that sandy region where the sun beat
pitilessly down all through the livelong hours of the day, and the heat
must be terrific.</p>

<p>Up where they were they could feel nothing of the earth’s radiation,
and doubtless it would be delightfully cool.</p>

<p>Beyond as far as the eye could reach, it held, that same glaring
stretch of glistening sand, on the surface of which toward noon it would
be easily possible to fry an egg; indeed Andy had actually done the same
on a previous visit, when they dropped down to discover how it felt to be
adrift in the midst of a desert, he having been put up to the game through
words spoken by Buckskin.</p>

<p>Far away to the west he saw the tops of high mountains, but they must
have been scores of miles off. Between doubtless lay the desert, with
perhaps a stretch of the plain where the grass grew, and
even flowers could be found in their season, all the difference being
brought about by the presence of earth in the one case and nothing but
sand in the other.</p>

<p>On this waste nothing seemed to grow save the cactus that stood up like
giant sentinels guarding the cemetery of centuries. Here and there one
could find the skulls and bones of unfortunate animals that had become
lost in the sand storms occasionally blowing over this heated stretch, to
perish miserably from suffocation or else subsequent thirst.</p>

<p>Straining his eyes Andy kept on looking, always hoping that the very
next minute might result in a pleasing discovery. If the glare caused his
eyes to burn he paid little attention to that discomfort. All the while he
was thinking how terrible it would be if they had, after all, made a
mistake in figuring out the probable way Jose would take in trying to
escape the penalty of his cruel deed. Should he have turned aside, and
continued to avoid the desert, all their work would go for nothing.</p>

<p>Still, Andy had the utmost confidence in his chum’s ability to grapple
with a question like this. He felt that Frank must know just about what
would be passing in the mind of the man they were hunting. Frank had a
faculty for putting himself in another’s place, and figuring
things out from that standpoint.</p>

<p>And then there was another comforting thought that came to Andy.
Supposing the fugitive had done this same thing, he could not reach the
border under several days, since the desert was extensive; and surely
there would be a good chance of the hard-riding cowboys coming up on him
meanwhile.</p>

<p>They would of course follow directly on his trail, their practiced eyes
picking it out of the many that crossed the level stretch to the south of
the ranch buildings. And like bloodhounds on the scent, once they had
started, they would keep it up to the end.</p>

<p>As the aeroplane pushed on, and neared the border of the desert, so
plainly marked below, Andy gave an ejaculation that caused Frank to look
expectant.</p>

<p>“A pony, Frank, yes, two of them feeding there, and without saddle or
bridle to show that they have been ridden. Whatever can that mean?” he
called out, so as to be heard above the humming of the motor.</p>

<p>“I think I can guess,” replied the other, quickly. “This has been a
deep-laid scheme, and no sudden fancy. Jose has made all sorts of
preparations for carrying it out with success. He knows that
perhaps his life would pay the penalty for any failure. So, you see, Andy,
chances are, he left two fresh ponies staked out here and ready for use
when he came along after riding the others for these twenty or more miles.
A quick change of saddles and bridles, and then he and the little girl
were away again, this time striking out straight across the sand, and
headed for the nearest point of the Mexican border.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like you had guessed it first pop out of the bottle,
Frank,” the other went on to say, “and if it’s so, then we’re bound to
come up on him before long.”</p>

<p>Andy once more started to glue his eyes to the end of the field
glasses. Carefully did he scrutinize every object he could pick out along
the horizon ahead. If he had any idea that it moved, he would stop in his
shifting movement to concentrate his gaze long and earnestly upon that one
spot; but only to give a grunt of bitter disappointment, and once more
continue to scan the waste of sand beyond.</p>

<p>So it went on for some time. The minutes must have seemed unduly long
to the ever anxious lad. Frank, more inclined to take things as they came,
always hoping for the best, was better able to control his emotions.
 It had perhaps been twenty minutes since they reached the
border of the desert, and now on all sides they could see actually nothing
but that same dead glare of the burning sun beating on the absorbing
sand.</p>

<p>Frank was himself thinking that they must have reached the limit of
distance which the fugitive could have covered, even though he had a fresh
relay of ponies to help him along; when once again he heard his cousin
give utterance to that bubbling little cry that seemed to announce a fresh
discovery.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='What Andy Saw From Aloft' id='chXX'>
CHAPTER XX—WHAT ANDY SAW FROM ALOFT
</h2>

<p>“No false alarm this time, eh, Andy?” asked Frank, quickly.</p>

<p>“I think not,” came the ready response.</p>

<p>“Ponies again?” queried the pilot, as he steadied the quivering biplane
by a little movement that had become second nature with both young
aviators; just as a boy rider on a bicycle unconsciously bends his body at
just the proper angle when about to whirl around a curve in the road.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the other replied.</p>

<p>“And riders too, this time, I hope?” Frank went on.</p>

<p>“I’m dead sure of it, because there are two horses, and they’re running
along side by side, Frank.”</p>

<p>“That looks more like it; and I want to say it’s about time we struck
some good warm scent about now. That Jose had been going at a mad pace
ever since the start, and the poor little girl, how I pity her, Andy.”</p>

<p>“But however in the wide world d’ye suppose she could stick on a pony
through it all?” the boy with the glasses asked, wonder in his
 voice, as he continued to keep watch upon the far distant
moving objects which he had discovered, thanks to the magnifying qualities
of the powerful lens.</p>

<p>“Oh! there’s only one answer to that, my boy,” answered Frank. “Jose
must have tied her to the pony. And even at that I feel mighty sorry for
the little thing, for it must have been a terrible run, all these
hours.”</p>

<p>“The inhuman scoundrel!” growled Andy, almost savagely. “I’d just like
to see him get what’s coming to him, if the boys ever lay hands on
him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” observed Frank, “I wouldn’t say that, until we find out how
Becky’s stood the long ride. If he’s been cruel to her besides, then I’d
be inclined to say what you did; but there’s always the chance that the
man really wants to have possession of his own child; for he’s her father,
we’ve got to remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but think of all we’ve heard from the boys at the ranch about how
badly he treated Mr. Witherspoon’s niece, after running away with her, and
marrying her. You needn’t tell me, Frank, that such a man is going to care
anything for his own child. Like enough he hates Becky, just because she
looks like the wife he treated so bad. And I’m ready to
 believe he’s doing this right now, not to get possession of
his own, but to strike a blow at Uncle Jethro, because he hates him
so.”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying that it isn’t so, because all things point that way,”
Frank continued. “But how are we coming on now, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Drawing up on them by degrees; but I notice that you’ve cut off more’n
a little power, Frank, and that we’re not rushing along as fast as we
were. Tell me, what have you done that for?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, now that we’ve sighted our game there’s no need of
rushing things at racehorse speed. We’d better go along a little slower,
and try to get the lay of things in our minds before we drop down, and
surprise Mr. Jose Sandero,” was the way the aeroplane pilot made
reply.</p>

<p>There was little of the haphazard about Frank. As a general rule he had
a reason for everything he did; and each move was carefully considered
beforehand.</p>

<p>Not that he could not do things with lightning-like rapidity when there
was actual need for haste, because he had frequently surprised even quick
moving Andy on occasions; but the chances were he had thought out all the
 results of the action before the occasion for it came
about.</p>

<p>And the beauty of the relationship between the two Bird boys lay in
this fact, that Andy recognized his cousin’s superiority of judgment, and
rarely, if ever, questioned his decision.</p>

<p>This did not mean that Andy was merely an “echo,” for that would be a
wrong view to take of the case; he had a mind of his own, and often Frank
was only too glad to ask his advice when a little in doubt himself. But
when two fellows keep company a long time as chums, they gradually come to
know each other “from the ground up,” as Andy would express it; and one of
them just naturally forges a little to the front as the leader.</p>

<p>In the case of the Bird boys it happened to be Frank, that was all.</p>

<p>As they kept on advancing after the moving figures, Andy would from
time to time continue to make some remark, as he looked through the
glasses; so that in this way Frank was posted on how things were
going.</p>

<p>Even though he cast an occasional glance ahead on his own account, as
yet he had not been able to exactly locate the fugitives. This might
partly be on account of the smallness of two ponies at such a distance;
and then again the glare of the sun, far up in the heavens,
in spite of the early hour, was very strong on the desert sand.</p>

<p>There was one thing that Frank was pretty positive about; he believed
that the fugitive Mexican could hardly as yet have discovered what was
coming after him. To his naked eye the aeroplane would hardly be noticed
at all; or if it did accidentally catch his attention, he would believe
that it was merely some buzzard, or perhaps a great bald eagle floating in
space far up in the blue expanse of sky.</p>

<p>If he looked back at all he would be more apt to confine his anxious
gaze to the level horizon, for it would be there an enemy was apt to
appear; no sane man could dream of an attack from above, since aeroplanes
have not yet become so common as to be recognized by everyone.</p>

<p>And so the pursuit went on.</p>

<p>Andy seemed deeply engrossed in his business of “keeping tab” on the
movements of those so far in front.</p>

<p>Presently he began to notice that Frank was doing something to effect a
change in their relative positions.</p>

<p>“Are you going down now?” Andy demanded a little fearfully, as though
he could not understand why such a move should be in order. 
“Better now, than later on,” returned the pilot. “We’re too high up to be
able to make any sort of landing when we want to. Besides now that you’ve
got track of Jose, there’s really no need of keeping to this high
elevation.”</p>

<p>“Then after you bring the biplane down to a lower level, we can just
rush things, if we think it best, is that it, Frank?”</p>

<p>“My notion to a dot, Andy.”</p>

<p>They were already circling around, so as to descend in the safer
“spirals.” Frank would not take the great risk of volplaning when the
other way answered just as well, and at one-tenth the chance of
accident.</p>

<p>Andy managed to keep his eyes on the distant ponies pretty much all the
time the aeroplane was dropping in those immense circles, each one lower
in the grand spiral than the preceding one.</p>

<p>“They’re gaining some on us, Frank!” he finally announced, regretfully,
as if he just could not bear the thought.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s a mere nothing,” declared his cousin, cheerfully; “and I
wouldn’t bother my head over it, if I were you, Andy. Why, when we get to
where I want to go, all I’ve got to do is to put on speed, and we’ll make
that up in three shakes of a lamb’s tail. What are two or
three miles to a wonder of the air that can, if hard pushed, clip along at
the rate of a hundred an hour, and perhaps that is far from the capacity
of a reliable biplane with a favorable wind.”</p>

<p>As usual Frank managed to cheer his chum up immediately.</p>

<p>“Sure, you’re about right, Frank, and I was silly to let it bother me.
But seems as if we ought to be down nearly far enough. If there were any
trees here we’d be only a couple of hundred feet or so above their tops.
And whew! Frank, I can feel the heat of that desert easy enough now, even
while we’re moving along like we are.”</p>

<p>“It’s all over now, and I don’t mean to go down any further. Tell me if
you can still see Jose and the little girl, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can see the ponies moving like crabs away off there; and I’m
taking it for granted that the ones we’re chasing after are mounted on the
same, Frank. Oh! wouldn’t it be a terrible disappointment now, if after we
got up close we found we’d been bamboozled, and that these were only a
couple of Indians, or Mexicans going back home after trading in some
American town?”</p>

<p>“There’s always a little chance that way,” Frank
admitted, “but all the same I don’t believe we’re going to be
disappointed. Traders would hardly strike across this desert, you
understand. It’s a bad place to get lost in, and mighty unpleasant
traveling at the best. Few people cross it, they said at the ranch. Once
in a while some Indians wander down here from their reservation in the
northern end of the State. You know the Navajos used to be in this region,
and the Comanches too, I was told, before the Government rounded them up,
and gave them lands up there, besides paying them a big sum every year in
money and supplies.”</p>

<p>“I wonder——” began Andy, and then stopped, while he screwed his eyes
still closer to the ends of the twin tubes of the marine glasses.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” asked Frank, realizing that in all probability
Andy had made some fresh discovery.</p>

<p>“Frank, there’s sure something moving over beyond where Jose and Becky
are plodding along. I can see several dots, and they have life to them,
too! It looks for all the world to me as if a pack of wolves might be
lying in wait for the ponies—half starved wolves maybe, crazy for a
chance to pull them down, and make a meal.” “Wolves,”
repeated the other, thoughtfully; “it would be hard for me to believe such
animals would ever be found in the middle of this sandy desert, where
they’d never find a bite of food in a year, and not a drop of water. You
must be mistaken, Andy; look again, won’t you, please?”</p>

<p>Nevertheless the suggestion appeared to influence Frank so that he
again sent the aeroplane ahead at full speed; and Andy had a little
difficulty in keeping his glasses steady when leveling them, such was the
constant vibration of the uprights, under the full force of the powerful
little Kinkaid engine.</p>

<p>But it was so much in sympathy with his own desire to get ahead that
Andy was willing to put up with almost any trouble. He knew instinctively
from the feel of the biplane that they were now speeding.</p>

<p>A minute later, and he gave another exclamation.</p>

<p>“Frank, I saw something flash just then; and as sure as you live I
believe it must have been the sunlight glistening on steel, just like it
might be a gun barrel or a knife!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you saw it ahead of Jose, and among the crawling
objects you thought were wolves?” demanded the other. “Yes,
yes, there it is again, Frank!”</p>

<p>“Well, that settles one thing then—they’re hardly wolves, Andy; for I
never yet heard of such animals carrying either guns or knives, did
you?”</p>

<p>“They’re spreading out, Frank, just like they were lying in wait for
Jose. And while it looks queer from up here why doesn’t he discover them,
I suppose that’s because they’re hiding behind some sand hills,” Andy went
on to say.</p>

<p>“But you don’t think any longer that they can be wolves, do you,
Andy?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” the other replied. “We’re getting closer all the time, and
now I can see that they must be walking on two legs; though for that
matter they seem to be sprawled out pretty much all of the time, like
great toads, hopping this way and that. And Jose, he don’t know what’s
waiting for him, not one little bit.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s still going on, is he?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, and now I can see that each pony has a rider; why, Frank, we’re
bearing down on them so fast that I can tell Jose from little Becky. It’s
her, all right, Frank. Don’t I see her hair flying out behind as she
rides. Oh! the meanness of that skunk making that little
 child gallop across this red-hot desert, just to save
himself from being caught by our boys.”</p>

<p>“Well, you could hardly blame him for that,” Frank went on to say, with
a touch of humor in his voice, “because what a bunch of furious cow
punchers wouldn’t do to him you could say in one breath. But tell me, how
does it look now?”</p>

<p>“They’re getting mighty close to where the men are waiting, Frank.
Whoever do you suppose they can be?”</p>

<p>“We’ve heard a lot about that Mexican cattle rustler, Carlos, since
we’ve come to the ranch; perhaps, now, these may be some of his crowd.
They’ve got no love for the Double X Ranch boys, you remember; and if they
think Jose and the child belong there, it’s going to go hard with them.
But you see we don’t know all about it yet. Take a closer look, Andy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got the lot in focus,” muttered the other.</p>

<p>“Do you see any feathers about them—examine their heads, and tell me,”
Frank went on to say.</p>

<p>“Feathers!” ejaculated Andy, in astonishment, “why what in the wide
world would—say, Frank, do you have an idea that they may be Indians?”
 “Well, I heard your uncle say that once in a while they’ve
seen a squad of the reds down this way, sort of escaped from their
reservation, and trying to see how it feels to be wild again. How about
those feathers, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Why, there does seem to be something queer about the heads of those
chaps, I give you my word there is, Frank. Honest now, I believe you’ve
struck it right, and that they are Indians, but Frank, would they hold
Jose up, and perhaps take his scalp, just like in the old days?”</p>

<p>“If so be they’ve been indulging in too much firewater. I wouldn’t put
even that past them,” the other boy answered, soberly.</p>

<p>“Well,” added Andy, with a shutting of his teeth; “I’m glad of one
thing, then.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” questioned the other.</p>

<p>“That we brought our bully old Marlins along, Frank!” was the quick
response Andy made.</p>

<h2 title='The Terror of the Air' id='chXXI'>
CHAPTER XXI—THE TERROR OF THE AIR
</h2>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better be getting the guns loose, Andy,” suggested
Frank, in his quiet way.</p>

<p>“You bet I will, and only too glad of the chance; but can you hold
yours while you steer; or shall I fix it, so you can grab it up the very
second you land the biplane on the sand?” Andy asked, as he let the
glasses hang by their strap, and with hands that doubtless trembled more
than a little, he proceeded to unfasten the two repeating Marlins with
which so much execution had been done on the occasion of the grizzly bear
hunt.</p>

<p>“Better lay it in the crotch you made for me, where I can get it in a
hurry when my hands are free,” the pilot explained.</p>

<p>By the time all this had been done they were of course much closer to
the scene of the expected trouble. And when Andy again picked up the
glasses, and clapped them to his eyes, he uttered new exclamations that
indicated excitement.</p>

<p>“It’s coming, Frank!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You mean the attack, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, because now Jose seems to have become suddenly
suspicious. There, I can see him jump off his pony, and he’s doing
something with Becky. As sure as anything, Frank, I do believe he’s
cutting the strap that’s held the child to the saddle. That looks like he
expects trouble, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“I should say yes,” replied Frank, shortly.</p>

<p>“Hark! did you hear that?” suddenly demanded Andy.</p>

<p>“I thought I caught a faint sound like a shot,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“That was just what it was, Frank. I saw the smoke long before we got
the crack of the gun.”</p>

<p>“Who fired?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“One of those concealed Indians; and there goes another, and yet a
third shot! Oh! Frank what if they should hit poor little Becky, the
half-drunken scamps, trying to believe these are the good old days when
they chased white men across the plains. Just listen to the shots would
you, Frank?”</p>

<p>Andy was fairly quivering with the nervous tension. What made it doubly
hard was the fact that while he could see these exciting things so easily
through the powerful lens of the glasses, yet they were still far away
from the scene of action and unable to raise a hand as yet
to render any assistance, should such be needed.</p>

<p>“What is Jose doing now?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh! one of the ponies seems to be down, and for the life of me I can’t
tell you whether it was shot, or has laid down like some of those cow
ponies are taught to do, Frank. There goes the other one the same way. And
now Jose has pulled the little girl down with him. They’re out of sight
behind the bodies of the ponies, I do believe, Frank!”</p>

<p>“Bully for Jose, then; he sure knows how to stand the Indians off!”
exclaimed Frank; and for the time being Andy seemed to forget that just a
minute or two back he had been declaring that the same Jose deserved the
worst punishment the cow-punchers from the Double X Ranch could deal out
to him, for he almost echoed the words of his chum.</p>

<p>“Good! good! he’s opened fire, too, for I can see the puff of smoke
each time he pulls trigger. Oh! Frank!”</p>

<p>“Well, what now?” demanded the other, a little impatiently, as Andy
paused after giving that last exclamation that might stand for almost
anything.</p>

<p>“He hit one of the Indians that time, as sure as
anything!” Andy declared, with a ring of delight in his voice.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I see him turn a flop, though; and right now he’s holding his
leg like fun! Guess he got a puncture in his tire, all right, Frank. After
all, that Jose can shoot some, let me tell you. There, I do believe he’s
gone and done it again!”</p>

<p>“What! hit another Indian, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Well, I c’n see a second fellow rolling over and over; and now he sits
up and it looks like he’s examining his arm. Perhaps they’re beginning to
learn that it ain’t all one sided after all, this stopping a mounted man,
and trying some of the old tricks. Mebbe they’ll want to clear out now,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be like Indian nature, from what they’ve been telling me
since we came here,” Frank went on to say. “They’re all as obstinate as
they make them; and the chances are, these fellows will just be more bent
on shooting Jose up than ever, if, as you say, he’s already pinked a
couple of their men.”</p>

<p>“Well, they don’t seem to be clearing out that I can notice, and that’s
a fact,” Andy admitted immediately afterward. Frank could
himself hear the reports of guns being discharged, and they came so thick
and fast that he could almost imagine a battle was being fought between
large numbers of enemies on either side. Evidently the Indians were flush
with ammunition, and did not hesitate to use it plentifully. The White
Father in Washington would supply them with plenty more when this was
gone; or at any rate the hard cash with which to purchase the same. And
they were just as prodigal in wasting cartridges as so many half-grown and
irresponsible boys might have been.</p>

<p>For the number of shots that kept ringing out, the amount of damage
done must have been remarkably small, from the accounts Andy kept giving
him.</p>

<p>The Indians were creeping along wherever they could find protection by
way of the sand dunes; and the watcher in the air declared that he
believed they meant to completely surround the man at bay, when doubtless
they could pour in such a hot fire that he would either have to surrender,
or else be wiped out.</p>

<p>It was a pretty exciting time for the two young aviators while they
were thus speeding toward the scene of the desert warfare. The biplane was
doing its level best, and yet so impatient was Andy to
arrive before the Indians had succeeded in accomplishing their terrible
work that it seemed to him they were fairly crawling along.</p>

<p>“Oh! can’t we go faster, Frank?” he begged more than once.</p>

<p>“We’re doing the limit right now,” Frank would answer.</p>

<p>“I suppose so, Frank, but don’t you know it seems like we’d never get
there at this pace,” Andy would go on to say.</p>

<p>“Keep cool,” was the advice of the other.</p>

<p>“I’m trying as hard as I can to do that, but it makes me shiver all
over when I think of poor little Becky being exposed to that shooting,”
said Andy, between his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hope Jose has been merciful enough to keep her lying flat
on the ground behind the ponies. They must be dead, Andy, because with all
that lead flying around no cayuse would ever consent to lie still, wounded
perhaps at that. And their bodies would protect the child, even if they
didn’t do the same altogether for the man. Is he still shooting?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t noticed a puff of smoke over the spot for some time—but
there, I did get a glimpse of one just then; and Frank, believe me, he
must have done it again, because I can see several of the
others crawling toward one that seems to be kicking on the ground. There,
they’re helping him away. Let me tell you that same Jose is no slouch when
it comes to using a gun. He must have had a lot of practice in the
revolutions they have every little while down in Mexico since Diaz was
kicked out. I take off my hat to Jose when it comes to knocking chips off
the shoulders of half-drunken reds.”</p>

<p>And this was the same Jose whom Andy had been saying such hard things
against only a short time before; but then circumstances alter cases; and
right now Jose was risking his life in defense of the little girl whom he
had for some reason kidnapped from her home.</p>

<p>When they had been observing these things some time back they may have
been as much as ten miles away from the scene of spirited action; but as
the biplane was spinning along at a tremendous pace, in spite of the
belief of Andy that it did not seem to be doing its best, this distance
was being rapidly diminished.</p>

<p>Whenever the shots came now they were plainly heard, as the air seemed
to be directly in the faces of the aeroplane boys while thus heading into
the south.</p>

<p>And Andy also noticed that they kept gradually sinking
just a little lower as they proceeded. Had he been able to allow himself
time to think this over, he must have guessed why Frank was doing this;
and that he wanted to avoid being discovered by the Indians until he could
suddenly burst upon their vision in a terrifying apparition, frightening
them so badly that they would only think of making a hasty flight.</p>

<p>Well, things were going on at such a pace now that whatever the outcome
might prove to be, it would soon be over. In a couple of minutes at most
the oncoming air wonder must have arrived so close to the scene of the
disturbance that its presence could no longer be concealed from the sharp
eyes of the Indians. Some warrior whose eyesight had not been so seriously
impaired by the strong drink he had purchased from some bootlegger or
trader, would while peeping around a sand dune, suddenly discover that
dreadful apparition coming straight through the air, with an angry mutter
that could only mean the sore displeasure of the Great Spirit, whose
messenger this frightful object must be.</p>

<p>And when this occurred, Frank was rather inclined to believe there
would be a scamper on the part of the frolicking Indians such as
 had not been seen on this same desert for many a day.</p>

<p>Luckily they could depend on the stability of their machine; and every
particular part of the framework had been carefully gone over just the
preceding day by the one whose hand now controlled the levers by means of
which the aeroplane was guided on its way through space.</p>

<p>Hence, there was little likelihood of any accident happening. Frank did
not allow the thought of such a thing to enter into his calculations. He
placed the fullest dependence upon those staunch steel guys and the
faithful little motor that never yet had failed him in time of need.</p>

<p>“Oh! will we ever get there?” groaned Andy.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, and hold on; we’re doing fine!” was Frank’s advice.</p>

<p>“But I think they’re getting ready to rush Jose now!” the other went on
to declare, with renewed excitement.</p>

<p>“What makes you think that, Andy?”</p>

<p>“They seem to have gathered in knots in three places, and act like they
meant to make a swoop down on him from all sides at once,” came the
answer.</p>

<p>“Well, if they’ll only hold off another minute or two
we’ll fix things so that their swoop’ll turn out a fizzle. Tell me when
they start out on the run, Andy, because I want to turn on our siren, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I clean forgot all about that little trick Frank!”</p>

<p>Frank some time before had arranged a contrivance by means of which he
could make the engine sound a loud-voiced whistle that he always called a
siren, because it had all the harsh, discordant notes of the big steam
fog-horns to be heard in some places along the stormy coasts of our
country, where the dangerous shoals or reefs make it important that
vessels should be warned while still far out at sea.</p>

<p>This could be made to do duty at a second’s notice. Of course the boys
did not often sound the deep-throated whistle or horn, because it was apt
to create too much alarm in every living thing that heard it for the first
time, animals as well as human beings.</p>

<p>But in a desperate case such as the one by which they were now
confronted this hoarse-tongued signal might prove the very finest
auxiliary they could hope to have in alarming the attacking Indians.</p>

<p>And here Andy, with his usual thoughtlessness had entirely forgotten
about such a means of sending out a warning; while Frank had
it in his mind all along. That little incident showed the difference
between the two cousins; for with all his good qualities Andy often forgot
things that it would have paid him well to remember.</p>

<p>Both of them were intensely interested by now, and a study of their set
faces would have been worth while. Andy did not depend on the glasses any
longer to tell how things were progressing, since they had come close
enough for him to see with the naked eye. Of course, the fact that they
were several hundred feet above the level of the sand gave considerable
assistance, for they were entirely free from the little dazzling heat
waves that must hug the face of the desert more and more as the day
advanced, making seeing perfectly a difficult job.</p>

<p>The seconds clicked along, each one in the mind of the impatient Andy
being registered by so many loud “pops” of the exhaust, for it was not
muffled now.</p>

<p>“There, what did I tell you, Frank; listen to those awful yells, would
you? Oh! he knocked one over then, I say! But the whole lot have started
up, and bending low down are sprinting in the direction of Jose as fast as
they can go. Frank, why don’t you do something before they
get to him? It’s now or never, I tell you; just hear the guns going off
with a rattle and a bang! Frank——”</p>

<p>But Andy’s words were suddenly lost in a most terrific roaring sound
that broke forth, as Frank turned on the big siren whistle or horn. Across
the face of the desert went the strange sound, in a wave that would
annihilate space. And coming to the startled ears of the on-rushing
Indians, it must have instantly riveted their attention.</p>

<p>Imagine their astonishment when upon raising their eyes for the first
time they discovered what seemed to be a tremendous bird rushing through
the air toward them and uttering that thrilling whoop, the like of which
none of them had ever heard before.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='The Bird Boys’ Triumph' id='chXXII'>
CHAPTER XXII—THE BIRD BOYS’ TRIUMPH
</h2>

<p>The aeroplane was speeding down upon the spot, with that loud-throated
siren going at full blast. Andy had been holding himself in so long now,
that it was utterly impossible for him to stand it any longer; so he too
let out a series of ear-piercing shrieks that at least added to the
din.</p>

<p>Not content with that the boy commenced firing his repeating Marlin. He
did not bother trying to take any particular aim, which would of course
have been next to impossible in the swaying aeroplane, any way; but only
meant to add all he could to the tremendous din accompanying their
swoop.</p>

<p>Frank could see all that happened, because they were no longer far
away. No need of glasses either at this stage of the game. He could note
the movements of every one of those who had been in the act of rushing the
Mexican at bay when the appearance of the biplane in the near heavens came
to put a damper on their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Although at first stunned by the sight that met their startled eyes,
and the ear-splitting sounds accompanying the same, the
runaway Indians from the reservation had quickly remembered that they
still had legs. If any of them had been a bit wobbly before, on account of
the potions they had been imbibing, it seemed to be driven from their
systems by this scare, for they ran like prize sprinters. Even the several
wounded warriors endeavoring to flatten themselves down behind the sand
dunes, as though in hopes of being able to hide from the argus eyes of
this wonder of the skies.</p>

<p>Andy no longer had any fears concerning the attack, for he saw that it
had been effectually broken up by their coming. He started to shout again,
but found it beyond his ability, for the situation had resolved itself
into a comical farce by this time in the boy’s mind, and offered all the
humorous aspects of a great joke.</p>

<p>But none of those Indians thought so, if one could judge from the way
they were running. Andy had seen rabbits speeding away after the crack of
a gun; but that was hardly in the same class with what those braves did
that morning.</p>

<p>Some of them jumped this way and that as they sped off; as though under
the impression that they might thus escape the swarm of bullets that their
imagination filled the air with, on hearing the crackle of Andy’s
fast-shooting gun. Others dodged behind each succeeding sand
hill, and then appearing beyond, continued their flight in eccentric
curves; only glad if by this means they might escape the terrible eye of
that mighty bird that came whirring along, letting out such hideous war
cries, and assuming all the appearances of a dragon as pictured by the
Chinese on their flags and everywhere.</p>

<p>Frank did not attempt to alight just then; he believed that it was good
policy to make sure that the hostiles had all been frightened off before
exposing the fact that after all it was only two boys in some clever
invention of the white man who had come upon the scene.</p>

<p>And so, instead of heading directly for the spot where Jose lay behind
the two ponies, which they now realized were surely dead, Frank continued
to sweep around in a widening circle.</p>

<p>It was worth while to see the abject terror of such of the Indians as
they passed over. They would flatten themselves on the burning sand, as
though hoping in this way to escape the attention of the terror that was
seeking its prey; nor did any one of them dare to turn his head to look
upward at the monstrous bird with that loud shriek.</p>

<p>From a distance one or two discharged guns at the speeding aeroplane,
but of course there was not one chance in ten thousand of
the bullets doing any execution while the Bird boys were rushing along at
such a pace; indeed, they did not even hear the whine of the passing
lead.</p>

<p>Frank had his hands full taking care of the biplane, so that even had
he desired to do so he could not have added anything to the racket. One
hand controlled the lever which brought about the circling movement of the
aeroplane, while with the other he kept that siren busy.</p>

<p>But by now Andy had bethought him of another means for adding to the
panic of the fleeing Indians. In the box just back of him he happened to
have a number of large cannon firecrackers. Under ordinary conditions
these would appear to be rather queer things to carry on an aeroplane; but
it seemed that Andy was particularly interested in experimenting with
dropping stones which he called “bombs,” from a great height, in order to
see how aeroplanes might be made useful in war times. And thinking some
time to rather astonish Frank by sending down some of those big
explosives, he had smuggled them aboard.</p>

<p>The idea had about passed from his mind at this time, but suddenly
remembering the big red crackers, he was now pulling them out, and feeling
for some of those wind matches they always carried when on a
trip, because they could be used no matter what current of air they
happened to be passing through.</p>

<p>Frank did not see what his cousin was doing. In the first place he had
enough to look after as it was; and then again, when he could spare a
second, he wanted to ascertain what the Indians were up to.</p>

<p>The first thing he knew about it was when a terrific report came from
directly under the aeroplane, and close to the face of the sandy stretch.
Immediately on top of it came a shriek from Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh! it nearly fell on top of that Indian before it exploded, Frank! If
only you could have seen him go head over heels; and now he’s running to
beat the band! Talk to me about a scared rabbit, these noble red men are
sure the limit. I really believe they think the Day of Judgment has come
along ahead of time. If you keep it up much longer, Frank, I’m going to
fall right out of my seat; I’m laughing so hard I just can’t sit
still.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps it’s about time we called a stop on the excitement, and
let the poor fellows get away,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“No danger of them coming back again,” ventured Andy, as he threw his
last big cannon cracker in the quarter where he had caught
sight of another brave trying to dig a hole in the sand, as though wild to
cover himself up, and thus avoid attracting the attention of the monster
bird.</p>

<p>His aim was pretty fair, since Andy had been practicing this thing for
quite some time now. The explosion took place on schedule time, too; and
with about as tremendous a result as before; since it sent the terrorized
warrior flying off as if he believed the Evil Spirit were in full
pursuit.</p>

<p>Frank turned back.</p>

<p>The coast seemed clear of Indians now, even the wounded braves having
found some way of hiding from sight. Perhaps they had in despair scooped
hollows out of the burning sand, and were even now lying under a scanty
covering of the same, trembling in mortal terror of discovery.</p>

<p>Neither of the Bird boys cared whether this were so or not. They had
succeeded in accomplishing their main object; which of course had been to
give the assailants of Jose a severe scare, so as to scatter them to the
four winds. And now the next thing they wanted to do was to drop to the
earth, and capture the man himself.</p>

<p>Accordingly Frank guided the biplane to where he thought
best to make his landing. Then he proceeded to accomplish this ordinary
feat with his accustomed ability.</p>

<p>As the sand was loose and liable to clog the wheels, he had to be
additionally careful about landing. And Frank had already experimented in
getting up again after dropping upon such a shifting bed, so that he knew
just how it should be done.</p>

<p>Picking out a spot which looked better than anything around it, he
brought the aeroplane to the ground so softly that it almost seemed like a
thistle-down blown by the wind, and alighting.</p>

<p>The motor had ceased to whirr, and the propellers to whizz as Andy,
clutching his Marlin in his grasp, sprang from his seat to the sand.</p>

<p>Frank was hardly three seconds behind him, and it might be noticed that
he too held one of the useful guns.</p>

<p>Who could tell what need they might have for these life preservers,
when adrift in such a desert land, and with reckless Indians all around
them; not to speak of the man who lay behind the two dead ponies, with his
gun covering them even now.</p>

<p>Frank was not taking any chances with Jose. He knew that the Mexican
must be in a desperate frame of mind, and ready to fight to the
 last gasp before he would consent to yield. And Frank
believed in strategy when it could be made to answer the purpose.</p>

<p>What they wanted above all else just now was the return of little Becky
to the care of her legal guardian. They were not appointed to wreak
vengeance on the head of the father who had seen fit to steal his own
child away. Besides, somehow, after seeing how valiantly Jose had held the
whole band of reservation Indians at bay, both boys felt considerable more
respect for the Mexican. At least he was no coward, even if his actions in
the past had been along that line, Jose, like so many of his class was a
bravo; he could display mean traits toward women and children, but face
half a dozen men in a brawl, or a fight like this, without showing the
white feather.</p>

<p>So Frank immediately held up his hand, as he called aloud:</p>

<p>“Halloo! Jose Sandero! do not fire upon us! We will not do you harm if
you turn over the child to us to take back to her home! Do you understand
me?”</p>

<p>They saw the figure of the Mexican now. He had scrambled to his feet to
face the boys who had come so happily to his rescue just in time to save
his life. Perhaps this fact was duly impressed upon the mind
of the man from across the border. He owed these lads something, and a
Mexican always has an exaggerated sense of his own honor; it is a heritage
he has received from his Spanish ancestors far back.</p>

<p>“Si, senors,” he answered back, in a mellow tone, “I understand. Come
closer that we may talk it over. I promise you I will not fire one shot.
Carramba! it is only one that I have left me, after all you saw.”</p>

<p>Then they advanced until close by where the two dead ponies lay. One
thought was in the minds of both Frank and his cousin—the little girl,
how had she fared while all the bullets were flying through the air, sent
by half-drunken Indians who cared little where they landed.</p>

<p>Jose had suffered. His left arm hung almost helplessly at his side, and
they could see that the blood was dripping from his fingers; but he
clutched his repeating gun in the right hand and seemed still full of the
lust of battle.</p>

<p>“How about the child; is she safe?” called Frank almost afraid to ask
the question, for his heart seemed in his throat with the dreadful
suspense.</p>

<p>“Surely, senors,” came the immediate reassuring reply. “I saw to it
that she lay flat on the ground where nothing could injure her.
 Look and see for yourselves,” and with that he spoke
something to little Becky, so that she immediately sprang to her feet and
stretched her tiny hands longingly toward the boys.</p>

<p>At that both of them experienced a deep sense of relief. It began to
look, if only Jose proved reasonable, that the end of their long and
arduous air chase was now in sight, and that presently they could proceed
back to the ranch, bearing with them the little sprite whose abduction had
created all this excitement.</p>

<p>“We would make terms with you, Jose,” said Frank in a business like
way.</p>

<p>“I am ready to hear what you have to say, young senor,” came the
reply.</p>

<p>“You admit that our coming has probably saved your life?” Frank went
on, thinking it the part of wisdom to have that point well understood in
the beginning.</p>

<p>“Si, senor, it is true, and for that Jose is grateful; if it had not
been so he would not consent to give up the child, even if you tried to
recover her by force. But you have done me a good turn, and perhaps we can
make terms. If, then, I hand her over, will you agree that I go my way
unmolested?”</p>

<p>“We willingly agree to that, Jose. You may be a bad man, but we saw you
stand off those Indians like a brave one, and for that we
respect you. Yes, we will promise not to raise a hand to molest you.
Listen Jose, if you place the little girl in our hands we will promise to
do even more than that, if so be you are courageous enough to trust
yourself with us in our aeroplane. We could rise with you, and fly far
away across the desert to where you will be near the border. There we can
land, and give you a chance to save yourself from these Indians, who may
hang around here, seeking revenge for the wounds you have given them.”</p>

<p>That was a square offer on the part of Frank. Andy held his breath,
wondering if the other would dare accept it. The same courage that had led
Jose to face the guns of the Indians might not be sufficient to allow of
his getting aboard that wonderful air bird, and let himself be carried up
among the clouds.</p>

<p>Jose was hesitating between opinions. He hardly knew which seemed the
worse of the two. But one danger he could understand, while the other was
along the line of the mysterious and unfathomable.</p>

<p>They saw him pondering for a full minute. Then, as if he had made up
his mind, he threw up his hand.</p>

<p>“I will accept your offer, senor,” he said. “A man can
die but once, and what matter if he fall from the clouds, he may never
know what hurts him. And if I am left here without a mount, the
Indians are sure to get me. Advance, then, senors, and fix it as you
please. I am ready to take the word of such honorable young men.”</p>

<p>But all the same Andy could see that he shuddered when he cast a glance
over toward the quarter where the stranded biplane lay, as though the mere
thought of allowing himself to be carried up in the regions of the upper
currents aboard that frail combination of engine, planes, and rigid
uprights and stays, struck Jose as with a cold breath from the Arctic
regions.</p>

CHAPTER XXIII—HOME AGAIN—CONCLUSION
</h2>

<p>Frank knew that they had better not loiter there. Still, he could not
see Jose losing blood like that, when it was so easy to stop the flow.</p>

<p>So, while Andy watched to see that none of the frightened Indians got
over their scare, and came sneaking back, bent on potting some of the
palefaces, Frank made a quick job of looking after the wounded arm of the
Mexican.</p>

<p>The man seemed to hardly know what to make of it all. He watched every
move of the amateur doctor as though he could not understand how any one
would be so generous toward an enemy. But Frank knew what he was doing,
and he meant to extract a promise from Jose, before they left him, that
never again would he dream of trying to do any injury toward either little
Becky or Mr. Witherspoon, her relative, and legally appointed guardian.
And he believed the man would keep such a promise faithfully too; for
Frank was a pretty good reader of human nature.</p>

<p>Then they all walked toward the aeroplane that lay there on the hot
sand as a camel of the desert might for its Arab owner,
prostrate for his mounting.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to fasten little Becky in; but with the man there
had to be some maneuvering, because a sudden movement on his part would
endanger them all. Jose drew a long breath as he took his seat, and held
grimly onto an upright with his one well hand, his rifle strapped to his
back meanwhile. It was as though he hardly expected to ever come safely
down again; but then he had carefully counted the cost, and having decided
his pride would not allow him to back out.</p>

<p>Frank knew that it would be a very difficult task to get the biplane to
travel over the sand at a rate of speed sufficient to allow of their
mounting when the proper moment came; but he had experimented so many
times, looking to some such contingency, that he believed he could
surmount every trouble.</p>

<p>He therefore moved the aeroplane with the help of the others, so that
he would have the assistance of the slight wind that was blowing.</p>

<p>Finally all was ready.</p>

<p>The motor began to hum, gradually increasing its note as Frank turned
on more power, on finding that his hopes were about to be fulfilled. Yes,
they were actually passing along over the sand now; for just
there it was packed more than in most places. Andy had held his breath
with the suspense, figuring on how he could climb back if he had to go
overboard to help push. But it was all right now, and such a move would
not be necessary.</p>

<p>When the final moment arrived, they started gradually upward. Frank
heard Jose gasp for breath, and he knew the Mexican must be saying his
prayers from the low mumble that drifted in at his ear; doubtless the man
was almost stiff with fright when he dared look down, and saw that he was
apparently as far above the surface of the desert as many mountain peaks
would be.</p>

<p>Frank knew what he was doing, and that if the man was left on the
desert in his present wounded and weakened condition, it was just the same
as giving him over to death, which might come in any one of several ways.
If the Indians did not get him he might starve or die from lack of water;
and then again, should the infuriated cow puncher band from the Double X
Ranch come upon Jose he might count on a short shrift and a rope.</p>

<p>After all was said and done, fortune had been so kind that no
irreparable damage had followed the bold raid of Jose, unless indeed poor
 old Tige had received a dose of poison as the boys had
feared. Little Becky seemed to have come through it all in very good
shape, and for these mercies Frank felt that they had great reason to be
thankful.</p>

<p>And that was mainly why he was now carrying Jose across the balance of
the desert to place him on the road to the near-by border, beyond which he
undoubtedly had friends who would take care of him.</p>

<p>Andy had not forgotten the Indians, and was constantly on the lookout
for any signs of them. Whenever he did sight a skulking figure Andy made
haste to squeeze the rubber that caused the siren to give tongue. Jose
nearly lost his hold the first time he heard that fierce whoop so close to
his ear; for of course in his nervous condition he thought that something
had burst, and that they were now bound to go tumbling down through all
that space to be splashed about below.</p>

<p>But that lasted for only a very brief time, since they speedily reached
a point far beyond where any of the fleeing Indians had gone. After that
it was plain sailing and they made rapid speed.</p>

<p>Then, after they had covered many miles in this fashion, with the
glasses Andy was able to make out trees ahead, and some sort
of ridge that doubtless marked the delimitation of the desert’s
border.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they drew. Jose began to actually consider that he
still had something of a chance to live through it all; though the balance
of his life he would certainly never be apt to forget what dreadful fears
had held him gripped fast in their power when up in a fast-flying
aeroplane.</p>

<p>Now the keen-eyed pilot was looking for a likely place to land, and
this he discovered close to the trees themselves, where the ground became
much firmer, and Jose could immediately get under shelter from the
broiling sun.</p>

<p>After coming down from that cool altitude the tremendous heat of the
desert was almost overpowering, and both boys were glad to know that they
did not have to continue on through it for any great length of time.</p>

<p>So Jose was finally landed. He seemed to be rejoiced to find himself
once more on solid ground. True, he would always boast of having been up
almost to the clouds, but it is unlikely that any ordinary attraction
could tempt him to try it again.</p>

<p>He shook hands with each of the boys when they were ready to once more
venture into unknown space with the aeroplane. Andy was a
little dubious about accepting that hand, which he felt pretty sure had
not always been free from crime; but then Frank had done it, and he felt
that he could not do better than imitate his cousin in such matters.</p>

<p>They had no particular trouble about the new launching; indeed, now
that the biplane was free from the weight of Jose, it seemed to mount
upward like a bird that has broken loose from its cage.</p>

<p>The last they saw of the Mexican he was waving a hand after them. And
Frank felt well satisfied with the morning’s work. He believed that not
only had they succeeded in rescuing the little girl, but that fortune had
allowed them to give a bad man a chance to open his eyes. It might be the
means of turning Jose Sandero from his evil ways; and then again the
incident was liable to be swallowed up by the demands of his hard life.
And probably they would never know.</p>

<p>Once again they were flying boldly across the wide stretch of desert,
with its lonely looking cactus plants, and its queer windrows of sand that
looked for all the world as though a giant comb had been drawn over the
land, leaving it in this peculiar condition. When, finally,
they reached the northern end of the desert, and headed direct for the
ranch house, possibly both of the Bird boys were feeling happier that ever
before in all their lives. They had accomplished what seemed next door to
a miracle, because, had the men in “chaps” chased after Jose, and
threatened to take him, there could be no telling what the desperate
Mexican might not have done rather than submit.</p>

<p>“Look there, Frank,” Andy was saying a little later, “you can see the
ranch house as plain as anything from here, and why, if that ain’t the
boys coming on the tear over yonder!”</p>

<p>Frank, looking, saw that his chum spoke the truth. There could be seen
a confused medley of boys and horses. They were whipping their mounts
madly, and using both hats and quirts to try and increase their speed.</p>

<p>“That must be Charley Woo among the front ones,” Frank remarked, after
he had taken a second good look.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can tell him miles off by his white clothes,” Andy went on to
say, “and he’s done himself proud, has Charley, this day. Uncle must be
there alongside, and asking more questions, as he tried to get a little
more speed out of his mount. And I reckon they’ve glimpsed
 us, Frank, by the way they act. Are we going to land and let
them see that Little Sunbeam is safe with us?”</p>

<p>“It would be cruelty to animals not to,” replied the pilot, as he
started to head gradually toward the earth.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, and they were surrounded by an eager, excited
throng, and when Buckskin, Shorty, and all that lot learned that little
Becky had not suffered to any serious extent as a result of her terribly
long and wearisome ride, bound on a pony as she had been, they “awoke all
creation,” as Andy declared, with their exultant whoops.</p>

<p>Nothing would do but that the boys must tell the whole story; and those
wild riders fairly held their breath as they listened to the modest
account of that most remarkable dash through space, to arrive just in the
nick of time—Frank called it the psychological moment, and then had to
stop and explain just what he meant by that, before they would let him
proceed.</p>

<p>It was the greatest story they had ever heard. They would never have
believed such a thing possible, only that they knew Frank and Andy never
told yarns, or even stretched a fish story. Besides, there was little
Becky ready to corroborate all that had been said. Mr.
Witherspoon insisted upon taking the child on his horse, and thus heading
for the ranch, while the boys continued their flight; of course they would
arrive at their destination an hour before the ponies could make it, and
thus relieve the minds of those who were there.</p>

<p>The round-up was all off for the present. Later on they could make
another start, and this time the boys would be along, to witness all that
was done, with Andy taking pictures of the various phases of the
operation, as long as his roll of films lasted.</p>

<p>But Mr. Witherspoon had learned a lesson, and never again would he
leave home without a sufficient guard remaining there at the ranch house
to handle any situation that might arise.</p>

<p>He took some of Frank’s philosophy, to the effect that he would always
after that be prepared for possibilities, since lightning can at times
apparently strike out of a clear sky.</p>

<p>The boys’ time on the ranch was now getting toward a close; but before
they left they had one pleasant surprise that made them feel happy. It was
just on the little maid’s sixth birthday that a tired Mexican came to the
place and asked to see Mr. Witherspoon.</p>

<p>It happened that both boys were with him, and remembering their recent
adventure in connection with one such greaser, they eyed the
dusty traveler with more or less curiosity. He handed Mr. Witherspoon a
packet which he said his master, who was a ranchero down in Chihuahua,
Mexico, had ordered him to get there before dark on this particular
day.</p>

<p>Opening the packet the ranchman disclosed some beautiful silken
garments such as would be apt to set a little girl wild with delight, and
also a lovely slender gold necklace with pearls as its ornaments.</p>

<p>When he had glanced at the paper that had come with this gift Mr.
Witherspoon smiled, and looked meaningly at the boys.</p>

<p>“Well, all I can say is, that you two boys are next door to wizards.
You’ve actually made an impression on a heart that I calculated was as hard
as flint. Here are some presents for our little girl,” and on the paper I
read in Spanish: “To the little Senorita Rebecca from her unworthy father,
on her sixth birthday. May the good God bless her.”</p>

<p>And neither of the boys so much as smiled, for they felt that in some
fashion that merciful act of Frank’s in treating Jose Sandero so
generously had borne such fruit as no one would ever have believed
possible.</p>

<p>When the time came for them to say goodbye to Uncle
Jethro and the jolly boys on the Double X Ranch, it was hard to do it. And
neither Frank nor Andy would ever forget the rousing cheers that burst
from the lips of those happy-go-lucky punchers, Buckskin, Waldo Kline,
Shorty, Alkali Joe and the rest, not forgetting even Charley Woo, when
they saw the last of them at the station.</p>

<p>Of course Frank and Andy reached their home town in safety, and in due
time the biplane once more rested in its accustomed hangar back of Frank
Bird’s home; with the first snow of winter covering the ground, and a
frosty tang in the air that was just the opposite of that torrid wave the
Bird boys struck when crossing the Arizona desert.</p>

<p>And it is to be hoped that we will have the pleasure of recounting
further thrilling adventures that befell these intrepid air pilots in
other volumes to succeed this. Meanwhile, having seen them safely through
experiences at the cattle ranch, and once more back home before the
delayed session of school opened, it only remains for us to say goodbye to
the reader and write—</p>
